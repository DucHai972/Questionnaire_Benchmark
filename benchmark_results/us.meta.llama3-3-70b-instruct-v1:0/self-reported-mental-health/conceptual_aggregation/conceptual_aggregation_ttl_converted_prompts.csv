</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section and count how many times the code ""1.0"" appears, as indicated by the schema for question ""QGender"" which states ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

From the provided data:
- Respondent148 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent76 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent6 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent102 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent71 has a Gender of ""2.0"".
- Respondent3 has a Gender of ""2.0"".
- Respondent145 has a Gender of ""2.0"".
- Respondent13 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent128 has a Gender of ""1.0"".
- Respondent74 has a Gender of ""1.0"".

Counting the ""1.0"" values gives us a total of 8 respondents who are male.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the pred:Happiness value is 8 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent57 has a pred:Happiness value of 8.0.
- Respondent36 has a pred:Happiness value of 8.0.
- Respondent25 has a pred:Happiness value of 9.0.
- Respondent80 has a pred:Happiness value of 8.0.
- Respondent91 has a pred:Happiness value of 7.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent49 has a pred:Happiness value of 0.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent65 has a pred:Happiness value of 7.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent11 has a pred:Happiness value of 5.0, which does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher are Respondent57, Respondent36, Respondent25, and Respondent80.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Depression of 5 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the value for 'Depression' is 5 or higher, as indicated by the predicate ""pred:Depression"". 

Upon reviewing the data, we find the following relevant entries:

- :Respondent43 pred:Depression 3.0 
- :Respondent66 pred:Depression 0.0 
- :Respondent124 pred:Depression 0.0 
- :Respondent76 pred:Depression 2.0

- :Respondent30 pred:Depression 0.0 
- :Respondent120 pred:Depression 3.0 
- :Respondent20 pred:Depression 0.0 
- :Respondent37 pred:Depression 1.0 

None of the respondents have a 'Depression' value of 5 or higher.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the questionnaire schema, the ""Gender"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2"" corresponds to ""Female"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent102: Gender 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent143: Gender 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent94: Gender 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent24: Gender 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent4: Gender 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent68: Gender 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent138: Gender 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent32: Gender 1.0 (Male)

From the provided data, there are 2 respondents who are female: Respondent94 and Respondent24.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section. According to the questionnaire schema, the ""Gender"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2.0"" corresponds to ""Female"".

After examining the responses, we find the following respondents with a gender of ""2.0"", indicating they are female:

- Respondent98 
- Respondent144 

Therefore, there are 2 female respondents.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Laughter of 7 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the value for 'Laughter' is 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent60 has a Laughter value of 8.0.
- Respondent85 has a Laughter value of 5.0.
- Respondent38 has a Laughter value of 6.0.
- Respondent1 has a Laughter value of 6.0.
- Respondent71 has a Laughter value of 10.0.
- Respondent34 has a Laughter value of 9.0.
- Respondent139 has a Laughter value of 4.0.
- Respondent65 has a Laughter value of 6.0.

Counting the respondents with a Laughter value of 7 or higher:

- Respondent60 (8.0)
- Respondent71 (10.0)
- Respondent34 (9.0)

There are 3 respondents with a Laughter value of 7 or higher, but since none of the respondents have exactly 7, and the question asks for 7 or higher, we count those above 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 7 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the pred:Happiness value is 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent17 has a pred:Happiness of 8.0
- Respondent122 has a pred:Happiness of 8.0
- Respondent93 has a pred:Happiness of 8.0
- Respondent132 has a pred:Happiness of 5.0
- Respondent28 has a pred:Happiness of 10.0
- Respondent115 has a pred:Happiness of 4.0

So, the respondents with a Happiness of 7 or higher are:

Respondent17, Respondent122, Respondent93, Respondent28

There are 4 respondents with a Happiness of 7 or higher, but since the question asks for a count, the answer is simply the number of respondents that meet the criteria. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the pred:Happiness value is 8 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent150 has a pred:Happiness of 8.0.
- Respondent38 has a pred:Happiness of 10.0.
- Respondent84 has a pred:Happiness of 8.0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section. According to the questions schema, the ""Gender"" field is a MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We will count the number of respondents with a ""Gender"" value of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".

From the responses section, we can see that the following respondents have a ""Gender"" value of ""1.0"":
:Respondent117
:Respondent130
:Respondent111
:Respondent30
:Respondent116

There are 5 respondents with a ""Gender"" value of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Depression of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the value for 'Depression' is 8 or higher.

Upon reviewing the data, we find the following respondents with their respective 'Depression' scores:

- Respondent87: Depression 1.0
- Respondent117: Depression 0.0
- Respondent103: Depression 0.0
- Respondent107: Depression 1.0
- Respondent25: Depression 0.0
- Respondent81: Depression 2.0
- Respondent110: Depression 0.0
- Respondent66: Depression 0.0
- Respondent96: Depression 0.0
- Respondent40: Depression 3.0
- Respondent122: Depression 0.0

None of the respondents have a 'Depression' score of 8 or higher.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the questionnaire schema, the ""Gender"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2"" corresponds to ""Female"".

After examining the responses, we find the following respondents with a gender of ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"":

- Respondent14
- Respondent27

Therefore, there are 2 female respondents in the data provided, but we need to check all respondents. 

Upon reviewing all the respondents:
 
- Respondent14: pred:Gender 2.0
- Respondent27: pred:Gender 2.0
- Respondent74: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent80: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent91: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent148: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent130: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent55: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent40: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent124: pred:Gender 1.0
- Respondent58: pred:Gender 1.0

There are indeed more respondents, but only two are female according to the provided data.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents born in 2004 have a Laughter greater than 5 and a Anger less than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the respondents who meet the specified criteria.

From the data, we can see that the following respondents were born in 2004:
- Respondent110
- Respondent144
- Respondent7
- Respondent70

Now, let's check their Laughter and Anger scores:
- Respondent110: Laughter = 10.0, Anger = 3.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent144: Laughter = 7.0, Anger = 2.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent7: Laughter = 6.0, Anger = 1.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent70: Laughter = 6.0, Anger = 4.0 (meets the criteria)

All of these respondents have a Laughter score greater than 5 and an Anger score less than 5.

Therefore, the answer is: 4",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents born in 2003 have a Worry greater than 4 and a Laughter less than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who meet the given criteria.

From the data, we can see that there are two respondents born in 2003: Respondent87 and Respondent47, and Respondent8.

Respondent87:
- Year of birth: 2003.0
- Worry: 2.0
- Laughter: 6.0

Respondent47:
- Year of birth: 2003.0
- Worry: 1.0
- Laughter: 5.0

Respondent8:
- Year of birth: 2003.0
- Worry: 2.0
- Laughter: 7.0

None of these respondents have a Worry greater than 4. 

Therefore, the answer is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data and calculate the total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'. We are looking for respondents where this total score equals exactly 11.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent95**: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 8.0
2. **Respondent80**: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Depression = 2.0, Total = 10.0
3. **Respondent84**: Life satisfaction = 9.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 9.0
4. **Respondent146**: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 2.0, Total = 9.0
5. **Respondent22**: Life satisfaction = 6.0, Depression = 1.0, Total = 7.0
6. **Respondent14**: Life satisfaction = 3.0, Depression = 3.0, Total = 6.0
7. **Respondent40**: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Depression = 3.0, Total = 11.0

Only **Respondent40** has a total score of exactly 11 for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Happiness' and 'Stress', add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 4.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent13**: Happiness = 6.0, Stress = 2.0, Total = 8.0
2. **Respondent21**: Happiness = 1.0, Stress = 3.0, Total = 4.0
3. **Respondent70**: Happiness = 8.0, Stress = 3.0, Total = 11.0
4. **Respondent114**: Happiness = 5.0, Stress = 2.0, Total = 7.0
5. **Respondent109**: Happiness = 0.0, Stress = 4.0, Total = 4.0
6. **Respondent125**: Happiness = 8.0, Stress = 2.0, Total = 10.0
7. **Respondent107**: Happiness = 5.0, Stress = 3.0, Total = 8.0

Only **Respondent21** and **Respondent109** have a total score of exactly 4 for 'Happiness' and 'Stress'.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' is exactly 4 is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We also know that the 'Life satisfaction' field is a Likert scale with scores ranging from 0 to 10.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can identify the following male respondents (Gender = 1.0) with a mother having more than 16 years of education:

- Respondent30: Mother's education = 16.0 years, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent73: Mother's education = 37.0 years, meets the criteria.
- Respondent89: Mother's education = 15.0 years, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent111: No parental education data provided.
- Respondent125: No parental education data provided.
- Respondent29: Mother's education = 7.0 years, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent135: Mother's education = 11.0 years, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent79: Mother's education = 11.0 years, does not meet the criteria.

Among these, only Respondent73 has a mother with more than 16 years of education. Now, we need to check if Respondent73 has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

Respondent73's 'Life satisfaction' score is 8.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, there is only 1 male respondent who meets the specified conditions. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We are interested in female respondents, so we will look for respondents with a 'Gender' score of 2.0.

We also know that the 'Parental_Education' field has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother', and we are interested in respondents with a mother who has more than 18 years of education.

Finally, we know that the 'Life_satisfaction' field is a Likert scale with scores ranging from 0 to 10, and we are interested in respondents with a score of 7 or higher.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who meet the criteria:

* Respondent15: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education = 16.0 (less than 18, so not included)
* Respondent2: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education = 11.0 (less than 18, so not included)
* Respondent53: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education = 5.0 (less than 18, so not included)
* Respondent78: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education = 25.0 (more than 18), Life satisfaction = 9.0 (meets the criteria)
* Respondent36: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education is not explicitly stated, but based on the pattern, it seems that only fathers' education is sometimes provided without mothers', however, Respondent36's mother's education is not given, so we cannot include this respondent.
* Respondent55: Male (Gender = 1.0), so not included
* Respondent57: Male (Gender = 1.0), so not included
* Respondent102: Male (Gender = 1.0), so not included
* Respondent15: Male (Gender = 1.0), so not included

Only Respondent78 meets all the criteria: female, mother with more than 18 years of education, and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

Therefore, the answer is 1.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' is exactly 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' and count those whose total score for these two metrics equals exactly 8.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent75**: Happiness = 9.0, Depression = 1.0, Total = 10.0
2. **Respondent84**: Happiness = 8.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 8.0
3. **Respondent31**: Happiness = 6.0, Depression = 3.0, Total = 9.0
4. **Respondent2**: Happiness = 7.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 7.0
5. **Respondent128**: Happiness = 8.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 8.0
6. **Respondent111**: Happiness = 8.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 8.0
7. **Respondent45**: Happiness = 9.0, Depression = 1.0, Total = 10.0
8. **Respondent34**: Happiness = 10.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 10.0
9. **Respondent98**: Happiness = 5.0, Depression = 0.0, Total = 5.0
10. **Respondent137**: Happiness = 7.0, Depression = 1.0, Total = 8.0

The respondents with a total score of exactly 8 for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' are:
- Respondent84
- Respondent128
- Respondent111
- Respondent137

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' is exactly 8 is 4.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the respondents whose total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' equals 11.

From the provided data, we can see the scores for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' for each respondent:

- Respondent81: Stress = 4.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0, Total = 8.0
- Respondent148: Stress = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Total = 9.0
- Respondent110: Stress = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Total = 11.0
- Respondent147: Stress = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 9.0, Total = 11.0
- Respondent104: Stress = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Total = 9.0
- Respondent107: Stress = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Total = 9.0
- Respondent75: Stress = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Total = 11.0
- Respondent30: Stress = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 10.0, Total = 13.0

The respondents with a total score of exactly 11 for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' are Respondent110, Respondent147, and Respondent75.

Therefore, the count of such respondents is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education:
- Respondent84 (Mother's education: 16.0 years) does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent44 (Mother's education: 17.0 years) meets the criteria.
- Respondent118 (Mother's education: 11.0 years) does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent93 (Mother's education: 12.0 years) does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent23 (Mother's education: 25.0 years) meets the criteria.
- Respondent112 (No parental education data) does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent28 (No parental education data) does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent63 (Mother's education: 21.0 years) meets the criteria.
- Respondent103 (Mother's education: 19.0 years) meets the criteria.
- Respondent135 (Mother's education: 11.0 years) does not meet the criteria.

Now, let's filter these respondents by 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher and by gender (male):
- Respondent44 is female, so does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent23 is male and has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6.0, so meets the criteria.
- Respondent63 is male and has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8.0, so meets the criteria.
- Respondent103 is female, so does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the number of male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data and calculate the sum of their 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' scores. We are looking for respondents where this sum equals exactly 10.

From the provided data:

- Respondent136: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Sum = 6
- Respondent131: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 6, Sum = 8
- Respondent50: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 9, Sum = 10
- Respondent90: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 4, Sum = 6
- Respondent38: Worry = 0, Enjoyment = 5, Sum = 5
- Respondent61: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Sum = 12
- Respondent27: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Sum = 12
- Respondent66: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Sum = 6

Only Respondent50 has a sum of 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' scores that equals exactly 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We also know that the 'Life satisfaction' field is a Likert scale with scores ranging from 0 to 10.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can identify the following female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education:

* Respondent127: Mother's education = 27 years, Gender = 2 (Female)
* Respondent115: Mother's education = 28 years, Gender = 2 (Female)
* Respondent149: Mother's education = 16 years, Gender = 1 (Male)
* Respondent40: Mother's education = not available, Gender = 1 (Male)
* Respondent20: Mother's education = 28 years, Gender = 1 (Male)
* Respondent46: Mother's education = 16 years, Gender = 2 (Female)
* Respondent119: Mother's education = 11 years, Gender = 2 (Female)
* Respondent145: Mother's education = 15 years, Gender = 2 (Female)
* Respondent149: Mother's education = 16 years, Gender = 1 (Male)

Among these respondents, the ones with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher are:

* Respondent127: Life satisfaction = 8
* Respondent115: Life satisfaction = 7
* Respondent46: Life satisfaction = 6

Therefore, the number of female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher is 2 (Respondent127 and Respondent115, and also Respondent20 is not included because is male, but Respondent46 is included because is female and have a life satisfaction of 6).

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents born in 2005 have a Loneliness greater than 5 and a Happiness less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents who meet the specified criteria.

1. **Born in 2005**: We look for respondents with `pred:Year_of_birth` equal to 2005.0.
2. **Loneliness greater than 5**: We look for respondents with `pred:Loneliness` greater than 5.
3. **Happiness less than 4**: We look for respondents with `pred:Happiness` less than 4.

After examining the data:

- Respondent39 was born in 2005 and has a Loneliness of 9.0 and Happiness of 8.0. This respondent does not meet the Happiness criterion.
- Respondent71 was born in 2005 and has a Loneliness of 8.0 and Happiness of 5.0. This respondent does not meet the Happiness criterion.
- Respondent91 was born in 2005 and has a Loneliness of 8.0 and Happiness of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the Happiness criterion.
- Respondent121 was born in 2005 and has a Loneliness of 4.0 and Happiness of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the Loneliness criterion.
- Respondent114 was not born in 2005, so is not considered.

None of the respondents born in 2005 have a Loneliness greater than 5 and a Happiness less than 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender and then compare each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average for their gender.

From the provided data, we can extract the following information regarding Life satisfaction and Gender:

- Respondent80: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent119: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent116: Life satisfaction = 6.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent10: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent15: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent95: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent74: Life satisfaction = 3.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent20: Life satisfaction = 9.0, Gender = 1.0 (Male)

First, let's calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender:

**Males (Gender = 1.0):**
- Respondent80: 8.0
- Respondent116: 6.0
- Respondent10: 8.0
- Respondent15: 7.0
- Respondent95: 8.0
- Respondent74: 3.0
- Respondent20: 9.0

Total Life satisfaction for Males = 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 3.0 + 9.0 = 49.0
Number of Males = 7
Average Life satisfaction for Males = 49.0 / 7 = 7.0

**Females (Gender = 2.0):**
- Respondent119: 8.0

Total Life satisfaction for Females = 8.0
Number of Females = 1
Average Life satisfaction for Females = 8.0 / 1 = 8.0

Now, let's compare each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average for their gender:

- Respondent80 (Male): 8.0 >= 7.0 (Yes)
- Respondent119 (Female): 8.0 == 8.0 (No, since it's not higher)
- Respondent116 (Male): 6.0 < 7.0 (No)
- Respondent10 (Male): 8.0 >= 7.0 (Yes)
- Respondent15 (Male): 7.0 == 7.0 (No, since it's not higher)
- Respondent95 (Male): 8.0 >= 7.0 (Yes)
- Respondent74 (Male): 3.0 < 7.0 (No)
- Respondent20 (Male): 9.0 > 7.0 (Yes)

Respondents with Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender:
- Respondent80
- Respondent10
- Respondent95
- Respondent20

Number of respondents with Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Happiness that is higher than the average Happiness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Happiness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Happiness score to the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.

Let's calculate the average Happiness for each gender based on the 'responses' section:

1. For Male (Gender = 1):
   - Respondent130: Happiness = 8.0
   - Respondent99: Happiness = 2.0
   - Respondent119: Happiness = 7.0
   - Respondent149: Happiness = 9.0
   - Respondent11: Happiness = 5.0
   - Respondent116: Happiness = 6.0

   Total Happiness for Males = 8.0 + 2.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 = 37.0
   Number of Males = 6
   Average Happiness for Males = 37.0 / 6 = 6.17

2. For Female (Gender = 2):
   - Respondent119: Happiness = 7.0
   - Respondent147: Happiness = 9.0
   - Respondent142: Happiness = 5.0

   Total Happiness for Females = 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 = 21.0
   Number of Females = 3
   Average Happiness for Females = 21.0 / 3 = 7.0

Now, let's identify respondents whose Happiness is higher than the average for their gender:

1. Males with Happiness > 6.17:
   - Respondent130: Happiness = 8.0 (Higher)
   - Respondent119: Happiness = 7.0 (Higher)
   - Respondent149: Happiness = 9.0 (Higher)

2. Females with Happiness > 7.0:
   - Respondent119: Happiness = 7.0 (Not higher, exactly average)
   - Respondent147: Happiness = 9.0 (Higher)
   - Respondent142: Happiness = 5.0 (Not higher)

Respondents with Happiness higher than the average for their gender:
- Respondent130
- Respondent119 (Male)
- Respondent149
- Respondent147

Count of such respondents = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - The 'Depressive Symptoms' section includes several questions. We need to sum the scores of these questions for each respondent to get their total 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

2. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - Group respondents by their 'Socio-economic status'.
   - For each group, sum all the 'Depressive Symptoms' scores and divide by the number of respondents in that group to find the average.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average score of their 'Socio-economic status' group.
   - Count how many respondents meet this condition.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's simplify the process with the information given:

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Data

- **Socio-economic status** is coded as 1 through 6.
- **Depressive Symptoms** are measured through several questions, but the exact questions and their codes are not directly relevant as long as we understand that we're summing scores.

### Step 2: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score

For each respondent, we sum the scores of:
- `Anhedonia`
- `Depressed_Mood`
- `Sleep_Problems`
- `Fatigue`
- `Appetite_Changes`
- `Feelings_of_Worthlessness`
- `Concentration_Difficulties`
- `Psychomotor_Changes`
- `Suicidal_Thoughts`

### Step 3: Group by 'Socio-economic status' and Calculate Averages

Given the data, we would group respondents by their `Socio_economic_status` and calculate the average `Depressive_Symptoms` score for each group.

### Step 4: Compare Scores

For each respondent, compare their total `Depressive_Symptoms` score to the average of their `Socio_economic_status` group. If it's higher, count them.

### Calculation

Due to the format requirements and the complexity of manually calculating each step without direct computational tools, let's outline the conceptual approach:

1. **Respondent 83** (`Socio_economic_status` = 3.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = 8.0

2. **Respondent 122** (`Socio_economic_status` = 3.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = 5.0

3. **Respondent 129** (`Socio_economic_status` = 5.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 0.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 3.0

4. **Respondent 39** (`Socio_economic_status` = 4.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 = 5.0

5. **Respondent 16** (`Socio_economic_status` = 2.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 = 7.0

6. **Respondent 116** (`Socio_economic_status` = 3.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = 4.0

7. **Respondent 27** (`Socio_economic_status` = 2.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 5.0

8. **Respondent 88** (`Socio_economic_status` = 4.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 0.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 4.0

9. **Respondent 22** (`Socio_economic_status` = 3.0):
   - Total `Depressive_Symptoms` = 2.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 = 12.0

### Averages Calculation

- **For Socio-economic status = 3.0**: (8.0 + 5.0 + 4.0 + 12.0) / 4 = 29.0 / 4 = 7.25
- **For Socio-economic status = 5.0**: (3.0) / 1 = 3.0
- **For Socio-economic status = 4.0**: (5.0 + 4.0) / 2 = 9.0 / 2 = 4.5
- **For Socio-economic status = 2.0**: (7.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 12.0 / 2 = 6.0

### Comparison

- **Respondent 83**: 8.0 > 7.25, No
- **Respondent 122**: 5.0 < 7.25, No
- **Respondent 129**: 3.0 = 3.0, No
- **Respondent 39**: 5.0 > 4.5, Yes
- **Respondent 16**: 7.0 > 6.0, Yes
- **Respondent 116**: 4.0 < 7.25, No
- **Respondent 27**: 5.0 < 6.0, No
- **Respondent 88**: 4.0 < 4.5, No
- **Respondent 22**: 12.0 > 7.25, Yes

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

### Step 1: Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction'

To find the overall average, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent45: 10.0
- Respondent11: 8.0
- Respondent64: 7.0
- Respondent113: 7.0
- Respondent135: 10.0
- Respondent134: 4.0
- Respondent41: 8.0
- Respondent94: 8.0
- Respondent96: 10.0
- Respondent73: 8.0
- Respondent100: 8.0
- Respondent105: 7.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 10.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 = 96.0

Total number of respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 96.0 / 12 = 8.0

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 1993: Respondent135 (10.0)
- 1998: Respondent11 (8.0)
- 1999: Respondent100 (8.0)
- 2001: Respondent94 (8.0)
- 2002: Respondent45 (10.0), Respondent113 (7.0), Respondent105 (7.0)
- 2003: Respondent134 (4.0), Respondent41 (8.0), Respondent73 (8.0)
- 2005: Respondent64 (7.0), Respondent96 (10.0)

Average 'Life satisfaction' for each year:
- 1993: 10.0
- 1998: 8.0
- 1999: 8.0
- 2001: 8.0
- 2002: (10.0 + 7.0 + 7.0) / 3 = 24.0 / 3 = 8.0
- 2003: (4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 20.0 / 3 = 6.67
- 2005: (7.0 + 10.0) / 2 = 17.0 / 2 = 8.5

### Step 3: Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0

Years with average greater than 8.0:
- 1993: 10.0
- 2005: 8.5

### Step 4: Count Respondents Born in Identified Years

Respondents born in 1993: Respondent135 (1)
Respondents born in 2005: Respondent64, Respondent96 (2)

Total respondents = 1 (1993) + 2 (2005) = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

### Step 1: Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction'

To find the overall average, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent14: 3.0
- Respondent86: 8.0
- Respondent17: 10.0
- Respondent85: 7.0
- Respondent25: 8.0
- Respondent143: 8.0
- Respondent99: 5.0
- Respondent73: 8.0
- Respondent65: 8.0
- Respondent39: 9.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 3.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 = 84.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 84.0 / 10 = 8.4

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 2002: Respondent14 (3.0)
- 2004: Respondent86 (8.0)
- 1999: Respondent17 (10.0)
- 2003: Respondent85 (7.0), Respondent73 (8.0)
- 2001: Respondent25 (8.0), Respondent99 (5.0)
- 2005: Respondent143 (8.0), Respondent65 (8.0), Respondent39 (9.0)

Average for 2002 = 3.0
Average for 2004 = 8.0
Average for 1999 = 10.0
Average for 2003 = (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
Average for 2001 = (8.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5
Average for 2005 = (8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 25.0 / 3 = 8.33

### Step 3: Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 8.4

Years with average greater than 8.4:
- 1999: 10.0

### Step 4: Count Respondents Born in Identified Years

Respondents born in 1999 = 1 (Respondent17)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Loneliness that is higher than the average Loneliness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Loneliness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Loneliness score to the average for their respective gender.

From the provided data, we can extract the following information regarding gender and Loneliness:

- Respondent21: Gender = 2 (Female), Loneliness = 10
- Respondent150: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 6
- Respondent37: Gender = 2 (Female), Loneliness = 3
- Respondent90: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 8
- Respondent80: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 2
- Respondent101: Gender = 2 (Female), Loneliness = 2
- Respondent34: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 0
- Respondent22: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 0
- Respondent144: Gender = 2 (Female), Loneliness = 6
- Respondent97: Gender = 1 (Male), Loneliness = 10

First, calculate the average Loneliness for each gender:

**Males (Gender = 1):**
- Respondent150: Loneliness = 6
- Respondent90: Loneliness = 8
- Respondent80: Loneliness = 2
- Respondent34: Loneliness = 0
- Respondent22: Loneliness = 0
- Respondent97: Loneliness = 10
- Average for Males = (6 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 10) / 6 = 26 / 6 = 4.33

**Females (Gender = 2):**
- Respondent21: Loneliness = 10
- Respondent37: Loneliness = 3
- Respondent101: Loneliness = 2
- Respondent144: Loneliness = 6
- Average for Females = (10 + 3 + 2 + 6) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25

Next, compare each respondent's Loneliness to the average for their gender:

- Respondent21 (Female): 10 > 5.25, Yes
- Respondent150 (Male): 6 > 4.33, Yes
- Respondent37 (Female): 3 < 5.25, No
- Respondent90 (Male): 8 > 4.33, Yes
- Respondent80 (Male): 2 < 4.33, No
- Respondent101 (Female): 2 < 5.25, No
- Respondent34 (Male): 0 < 4.33, No
- Respondent22 (Male): 0 < 4.33, No
- Respondent144 (Female): 6 < 5.25, No
- Respondent97 (Male): 10 > 4.33, Yes

Count the respondents with Loneliness higher than the average for their gender:
- Respondent21
- Respondent150
- Respondent90
- Respondent97

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

### Step 1: Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction'

To find the overall average 'Life satisfaction', we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent33: 5.0
- Respondent135: 10.0
- Respondent24: 8.0
- Respondent109: 9.0
- Respondent131: 4.0
- Respondent93: 8.0
- Respondent5: 5.0
- Respondent80: 8.0
- Respondent47: 8.0
- Respondent55: 10.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 = 75.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 75.0 / 10 = 7.5

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth

We group respondents by their year of birth and calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year.

- Year 2002: Respondent80 (8.0)
- Year 2003: Respondent109 (9.0), Respondent131 (4.0), Respondent93 (8.0), Respondent5 (5.0), Respondent47 (8.0), Respondent55 (10.0)
- Year 2004: Respondent33 (5.0), Respondent24 (8.0)
- Year 1993: Respondent135 (10.0)

Average for 2002 = 8.0
Average for 2003 = (9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 10.0) / 6 = 44.0 / 6 = 7.333...
Average for 2004 = (5.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5
Average for 1993 = 10.0

### Step 3: Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' is 7.5. We look for years with an average greater than 7.5.

- Year 2002: 8.0 (greater than 7.5)
- Year 2003: 7.333... (less than 7.5)
- Year 2004: 6.5 (less than 7.5)
- Year 1993: 10.0 (greater than 7.5)

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average are 2002 and 1993.

### Step 4: Count Respondents Born in Identified Years

- Year 2002: 1 respondent (Respondent80)
- Year 1993: 1 respondent (Respondent135)

Total respondents born in years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average = 1 (2002) + 1 (1993) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, we sum up the scores of `Anhedonia`, `Depressed_Mood`, `Sleep_Problems`, `Fatigue`, `Appetite_Changes`, `Feelings_of_Worthlessness`, `Concentration_Difficulties`, `Psychomotor_Changes`, and `Suicidal_Thoughts`.

2. **Determine 'Socio-economic status' Group for Each Respondent:**
   - Identify the 'Socio-economic status' for each respondent.

3. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - Group respondents by their 'Socio-economic status'.
   - For each group, calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average score of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

5. **Count Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**
   - Count how many respondents have a 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's simplify the calculation process by directly analyzing the provided data:

### Respondents and Their 'Depressive Symptoms' Scores

- **Respondent125**: Score = 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+0 = 4, Socio-economic status = 1
- **Respondent50**: Score = 0+0+0+0+1+1+0+0 = 2, Socio-economic status = 3
- **Respondent58**: Score = 1+0+1+2+0+0+0+0 = 4, Socio-economic status = 1
- **Respondent36**: Score = 0+0+1+1+0+0+0+0 = 2, Socio-economic status = 3
- **Respondent40**: Score = 2+3+2+3+1+0+0+0 = 11, Socio-economic status = 1
- **Respondent20**: Score = 0+1+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 1, Socio-economic status = 6
- **Respondent76**: Score = 2+1+1+0+1+0+0+3 = 8, Socio-economic status = 2
- **Respondent26**: Score = 1+2+2+2+2+1+2+1 = 11, Socio-economic status = 3
- **Respondent130**: Score = 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 0, Socio-economic status = 6
- **Respondent139**: Score = 3+3+2+0+0+0+0+0 = 8, Socio-economic status = 5

### Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score by 'Socio-economic status'

- **Socio-economic status = 1**: Average = (4+4+11)/3 = 19/3 = 6.33
- **Socio-economic status = 2**: Average = 8/1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status = 3**: Average = (2+2+11)/3 = 15/3 = 5
- **Socio-economic status = 5**: Average = 8/1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status = 6**: Average = (1+0)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5

### Comparison

- **Respondent125** (Score = 4, Average = 6.33): Lower
- **Respondent50** (Score = 2, Average = 5): Lower
- **Respondent58** (Score = 4, Average = 6.33): Lower
- **Respondent36** (Score = 2, Average = 5): Lower
- **Respondent40** (Score = 11, Average = 6.33): Higher
- **Respondent20** (Score = 1, Average = 0.5): Higher
- **Respondent76** (Score = 8, Average = 8): Equal
- **Respondent26** (Score = 11, Average = 5): Higher
- **Respondent130** (Score = 0, Average = 0.5): Lower
- **Respondent139** (Score = 8, Average = 8): Equal

### Count

Respondents with scores higher than their group's average: **Respondent40**, **Respondent20**, **Respondent26**

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

### Step 1: Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction'

To find the overall average, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent10: 8.0
- Respondent87: 7.0
- Respondent34: 10.0
- Respondent97: 6.0
- Respondent40: 8.0
- Respondent42: 8.0
- Respondent47: 8.0
- Respondent43: 7.0
- Respondent113: 7.0
- Respondent12: 6.0
- Respondent106: 5.0
- Respondent94: 8.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 = 88.0

Total number of respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 88.0 / 12 ≈ 7.33

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 2001: Respondent94 (8.0)
- 2002: Respondent10 (8.0), Respondent97 (6.0), Respondent113 (7.0), Respondent106 (5.0)
- 2003: Respondent87 (7.0), Respondent34 (10.0), Respondent47 (8.0)
- 2004: Respondent40 (8.0), Respondent12 (6.0)
- 2005: Respondent42 (8.0), Respondent43 (7.0)

Average for 2001 = 8.0
Average for 2002 = (8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0) / 4 = 26.0 / 4 = 6.5
Average for 2003 = (7.0 + 10.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 25.0 / 3 ≈ 8.33
Average for 2004 = (8.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 14.0 / 2 = 7.0
Average for 2005 = (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5

### Step 3: Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' ≈ 7.33

Years with average greater than overall average:
- 2003: Average 'Life satisfaction' ≈ 8.33
- 2005: Average 'Life satisfaction' = 7.5 (this is actually less than 7.33 when considering the precise calculation, my apologies for the oversight)

Correcting the evaluation:
- Only 2003 has an average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average.

### Step 4: Count Respondents Born in Identified Years

Respondents born in 2003:
- Respondent87
- Respondent34
- Respondent47

Number of respondents = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Anger that is higher than the average Anger for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Anger for each gender and then compare each respondent's Anger score to this average based on their gender.

From the provided data, we can extract the following information relevant to the task:

1. Gender of each respondent
2. Anger score of each respondent

Let's calculate the average Anger score for each gender:

- Male (Gender 1.0):
  - Respondent114: Anger 1.0
  - Respondent73: Anger 1.0
  - Respondent60: Anger 3.0
  - Respondent80: Anger 4.0
  - Respondent137: Anger 2.0
  - Respondent121: Anger 1.0
  - Total Anger for Males: 1.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 = 12.0
  - Number of Males: 6
  - Average Anger for Males: 12.0 / 6 = 2.0

- Female (Gender 2.0):
  - Respondent115: Anger 3.0
  - Respondent62: Anger 4.0
  - Respondent50: Anger 2.0
  - Total Anger for Females: 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 = 9.0
  - Number of Females: 3
  - Average Anger for Females: 9.0 / 3 = 3.0

Now, let's identify respondents with an Anger score higher than the average for their gender:

- Males with Anger > 2.0: Respondent60 (Anger 3.0), Respondent80 (Anger 4.0)
- Females with Anger > 3.0: Respondent115 (Anger 3.0) does not exceed the average, Respondent62 (Anger 4.0) exceeds the average

Thus, the respondents with an Anger score higher than the average for their gender are:

- Respondent60
- Respondent80
- Respondent62

There are 3 respondents with an Anger score higher than the average Anger for their gender.",True
