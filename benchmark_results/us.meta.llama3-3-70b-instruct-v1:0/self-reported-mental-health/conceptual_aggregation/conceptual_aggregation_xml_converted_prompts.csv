<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the answers to the ""Gender"" question. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"".

We then examine each respondent's answer to the ""Gender"" question:

- Respondent 148: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 76: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 6: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 102: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 71: <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>
- Respondent 3: <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>
- Respondent 145: <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>
- Respondent 13: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 128: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>
- Respondent 74: <answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>

Counting the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"" (which corresponds to ""Male"") gives us a total of 7 male respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided dataset and look for respondents who have answered 8 or higher to the question ""Happiness"".

From the dataset, we can see the following respondents have a Happiness of 8 or higher:

- Respondent 57: Happiness = 8.0
- Respondent 36: Happiness = 8.0
- Respondent 25: Happiness = 9.0
- Respondent 80: Happiness = 8.0

Counting these respondents, we find that there are 4 respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the answers to the ""Gender"" question. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". 

We will go through each respondent's answer to the ""Gender"" question and count the number of respondents who answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

Respondent 102: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 143: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 94: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 24: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 4: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 68: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 138: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 32: 1.0 (Male)

There are 2 respondents who are female.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the answers to the ""Gender"" question. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". 

We will go through each respondent's answer to the ""Gender"" question and count the number of respondents who answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

Respondent 95: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 68: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 150: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 98: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 96: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 28: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 60: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 121: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 7: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 144: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 84: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 57: 1.0 (Male)

There are 2 respondents who answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Laughter of 7 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the dataset and look for respondents who answered 7 or higher to the ""Laughter"" question.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 60 answered 8.0
- Respondent 85 answered 5.0
- Respondent 38 answered 6.0
- Respondent 1 answered 6.0
- Respondent 71 answered 10.0
- Respondent 34 answered 9.0
- Respondent 139 answered 4.0
- Respondent 65 answered 6.0

We are looking for respondents with a Laughter score of 7 or higher. Thus, the respondents who meet this criterion are:

- Respondent 60 (8.0)
- Respondent 71 (10.0)
- Respondent 34 (9.0)

There are 3 respondents with a Laughter score of 7 or higher, but since respondent 38 and respondent 1 and respondent 65 have scores of 6.0, they do not meet the criterion of 7 or higher. 

However, upon re-examining the instruction, it's clear that the count should include all respondents with a score of 7 or higher. Since none of the respondents scored exactly 7, but some scored higher than 7, we count those who scored 8 or higher, which are:

- Respondent 60 (8.0)
- Respondent 71 (10.0)
- Respondent 34 (9.0)

And also, we should include those who scored exactly 7 or more but in this case, there are none who scored exactly 7. 

Therefore, the total count of respondents with a Laughter score of 7 or higher is 3, based on the scores provided. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 5 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the dataset and look for respondents who have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 29 has a Happiness score of 6.0
- Respondent 7 has a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 34 has a Happiness score of 10.0
- Respondent 4 has a Happiness score of 9.0
- Respondent 92 has a Happiness score of 7.0
- Respondent 61 has a Happiness score of 9.0
- Respondent 83 has a Happiness score of 4.0

Counting the respondents with a Happiness score of 5 or higher:

1. Respondent 29 (Happiness score of 6.0)
2. Respondent 7 (Happiness score of 8.0)
3. Respondent 34 (Happiness score of 10.0)
4. Respondent 4 (Happiness score of 9.0)
5. Respondent 92 (Happiness score of 7.0)
6. Respondent 61 (Happiness score of 9.0)

There are 6 respondents with a Happiness score of 5 or higher.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 7 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided dataset and look for respondents who have a 'Happiness' score of 7 or higher.

From the dataset:

- Respondent 17 has a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 122 has a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 93 has a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 132 has a Happiness score of 5.0
- Respondent 28 has a Happiness score of 10.0

Counting the respondents with a Happiness score of 7 or higher:

1. Respondent 17
2. Respondent 122
3. Respondent 93
4. Respondent 28

There are 4 respondents with a Happiness score of 7 or higher, but since respondent 132 has a score less than 7, and there are no other respondents with scores of exactly 7, the count remains as the number of respondents with scores above 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a Happiness of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the dataset and look for respondents who have a 'Happiness' score of 8 or higher.

From the provided data, the following respondents have a 'Happiness' score of 8 or higher:
- Respondent 17 with a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 84 with a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 150 with a Happiness score of 8.0
- Respondent 38 with a Happiness score of 10.0
- Respondent 141 with a Happiness score of 6.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 21 with a Happiness score of 1.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 19 with a Happiness score of 6.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 114 with a Happiness score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 83 with a Happiness score of 4.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 33 with a Happiness score of 4.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 71 with a Happiness score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 98 with a Happiness score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)

Counting the respondents with a Happiness score of 8 or higher, we find:
- Respondent 17
- Respondent 84
- Respondent 150
- Respondent 38

There are 4 respondents with a Happiness score of 8 or higher, and also respondent 141 is not included because the happiness is 6.0, and the rest of the respondents are not included because their happiness score is lower than 8.0. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the answers to the ""Gender"" question. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". 

We will go through each respondent's answer to the ""Gender"" question and count the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".

Respondent 117: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 130: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 111: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 26: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 30: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 142: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 56: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 116: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 59: Gender = 2.0 (Female)

There are 5 respondents who are male.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the answers to the ""Gender"" question. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". 

We will go through each respondent's answer to the ""Gender"" question and count the number of respondents who answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

Respondent 14: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 74: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 80: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 91: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 27: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 148: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 130: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 55: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 40: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 124: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 58: 1.0 (Male)

There are 2 respondents who are female: Respondent 14 and Respondent 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents born in 2004 have a Laughter greater than 5 and a Anger less than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who meet the given criteria.

We are looking for respondents born in 2004, so we need to find the respondents with 'Year of birth' equal to 2004. We also need to find the respondents with 'Laughter' greater than 5 and 'Anger' less than 5.

Let's examine the respondents:

- Respondent 110: Born in 2004, Laughter = 10, Anger = 3. Meets the criteria.
- Respondent 144: Born in 2004, Laughter = 7, Anger = 2. Meets the criteria.
- Respondent 7: Born in 2004, Laughter = 6, Anger = 1. Meets the criteria.
- Respondent 70: Born in 2004, Laughter = 6, Anger = 4. Meets the criteria.

There are 4 respondents who meet the given criteria. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents born in 2003 have a Worry greater than 4 and a Laughter less than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who meet the given criteria.

We are looking for respondents born in 2003, with a Worry score greater than 4, and a Laughter score less than 6.

From the dataset, we can see that there are two respondents born in 2003: respondent 87 and respondent 47, and respondent 8.

Respondent 87 has a Worry score of 2.0, which is not greater than 4.
Respondent 47 has a Worry score of 1.0, which is not greater than 4.
Respondent 8 has a Worry score of 2.0, which is not greater than 4.

Since none of the respondents born in 2003 have a Worry score greater than 4, the answer is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 17 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset based on the schema provided in the 'questions' section.

1. Identify female respondents: 
   - The 'Gender' question is an MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". Therefore, we are looking for respondents with a 'Gender' answer of ""2.0"".

2. Identify respondents with a mother having more than 17 years of education:
   - The 'Parental Education' question has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother'. We need to find respondents where the 'Mother' sub-answer is greater than ""17.0"".

3. Identify respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher:
   - The 'Life satisfaction' question is a Likert scale from 0 to 10. We need to find respondents with an answer of ""8.0"" or higher.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent ""136"" is female (""2.0""), her mother has ""5.0"" years of education, and her 'Life satisfaction' is ""6.0"". This respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""56"" is female (""2.0""), her mother has ""17.0"" years of education, and her 'Life satisfaction' is ""7.0"". This respondent does not meet the criteria because her mother has exactly 17 years of education, not more than 17.
- Respondent ""97"" is male (""1.0""), so does not meet the gender criterion.
- Respondent ""108"" is female (""2.0""), but there is no 'Parental Education' data provided for her.
- Respondent ""117"" is male (""1.0""), so does not meet the gender criterion.
- Respondent ""88"" is male (""1.0""), so does not meet the gender criterion.

None of the female respondents have a mother with more than 17 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher based on the provided data.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'. We then check if this total score equals 11 and count such respondents.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 95: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
2. Respondent 80: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 2, Total = 10
3. Respondent 84: Life satisfaction = 9, Depression = 0, Total = 9
4. Respondent 146: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 2, Total = 9
5. Respondent 22: Life satisfaction = 6, Depression = 1, Total = 7
6. Respondent 14: Life satisfaction = 3, Depression = 3, Total = 6
7. Respondent 40: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 3, Total = 11

Only Respondent 40 has a total score of exactly 11 for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress'. We then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 4.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 13: Happiness = 6, Stress = 2, Total = 8
- Respondent 21: Happiness = 1, Stress = 3, Total = 4
- Respondent 70: Happiness = 8, Stress = 3, Total = 11
- Respondent 114: Happiness = 5, Stress = 2, Total = 7
- Respondent 109: Happiness = 0, Stress = 4, Total = 4
- Respondent 125: Happiness = 8, Stress = 2, Total = 10
- Respondent 107: Happiness = 5, Stress = 3, Total = 8

Respondents 21 and 109 have a total score of exactly 4 for 'Happiness' and 'Stress'.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who meet the specified criteria.

First, we need to identify the male respondents. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Gender' question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. So, we are looking for respondents with a 'Gender' answer of 1.0.

Next, we need to find the respondents whose mother has more than 16 years of education. The 'Parental Education' question has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother', and the answer is an open-ended field. We need to find the respondents with a 'Mother' sub-answer greater than 16.0.

Finally, we need to find the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher. The 'Life satisfaction' question is a Likert scale with a range of 0-10, so we are looking for respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' answer of 6.0 or more.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents meet the specified criteria:

- Respondent 56 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 17.0 years of education, but their 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0, which meets the criteria, and their gender is 2.0, which is female.
- Respondent 132 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 30.0 years of education, but their 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0, which meets the criteria, and their gender is 2.0, which is female.
- Respondent 30 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 16.0 years of education, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 89 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 15.0 years of education, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 111 does not meet the criteria because their 'Parental Education' answer is empty.
- Respondent 29 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 7.0 years of education, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 73 does not meet the criteria because their gender is 1.0, which is male, their mother has 37.0 years of education, which meets the criteria, and their 'Life satisfaction' score is 8.0, which meets the criteria. So, this respondent meets the criteria.
- Respondent 125 does not meet the criteria because their 'Parental Education' answer is empty.
- Respondent 135 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 11.0 years of education, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 79 does not meet the criteria because their mother has 11.0 years of education, which does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, only 1 male respondent meets the specified criteria. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Gender' question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We also know that the 'Parental Education' question has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother', and that the 'Life satisfaction' question is a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can identify the following female respondents (Gender = 2.0) with a mother with more than 18 years of education:

- Respondent 15: Mother's education = 16.0 (less than 18)
- Respondent 2: Mother's education = 11.0 (less than 18)
- Respondent 53: Mother's education = 5.0 (less than 18)
- Respondent 78: Mother's education = 25.0 (more than 18)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' is exactly 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression'. We then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 8.

From the provided data, we can see the scores for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' for each respondent. 

Respondent 75: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1, Total = 10
Respondent 84: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
Respondent 31: Happiness = 6, Depression = 3, Total = 9
Respondent 2: Happiness = 7, Depression = 0, Total = 7
Respondent 128: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
Respondent 111: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
Respondent 45: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1, Total = 10
Respondent 34: Happiness = 10, Depression = 0, Total = 10
Respondent 98: Happiness = 5, Depression = 0, Total = 5
Respondent 137: Happiness = 7, Depression = 1, Total = 8

Now, let's count the respondents with a total score of exactly 8:
- Respondent 84: Total = 8
- Respondent 128: Total = 8
- Respondent 111: Total = 8
- Respondent 137: Total = 8

There are 4 respondents with a total score of exactly 8 for 'Happiness' and 'Depression'.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents born in 2003 have a Anger greater than 4 and a Learning less than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who meet the specified conditions.

We are looking for respondents born in 2003, with an Anger score greater than 4, and a Learning score less than 5.

From the dataset, we can see that there is only one respondent born in 2003, which is respondent id ""19"" and respondent id ""5"". 

Respondent id ""19"" has an Anger score of 2.0, which is not greater than 4. 
Respondent id ""5"" has an Anger score of 4.0, which is also not greater than 4.

Since neither of the respondents born in 2003 has an Anger score greater than 4, the answer is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction'. We then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 11.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 81: Stress = 4.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0, Total = 8.0
- Respondent 148: Stress = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Total = 9.0
- Respondent 110: Stress = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Total = 11.0
- Respondent 147: Stress = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 9.0, Total = 11.0
- Respondent 104: Stress = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Total = 9.0

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and identify the male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Gender' question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We also know that the 'Parental Education' question has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother', and that the 'Life satisfaction' question is a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Analyzing the 'responses' section, we can identify the following male respondents who meet the criteria:

- Respondent 6: Male, Mother's education = no answer, Life satisfaction = 6.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not answered)
- Respondent 84: Male, Mother's education = 16.0, Life satisfaction = 9.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is exactly 16 years)
- Respondent 44: Female, so does not meet the criteria
- Respondent 118: Female, so does not meet the criteria
- Respondent 93: Male, Mother's education = 12.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is less than 16 years)
- Respondent 23: Male, Mother's education = 25.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent 112: Male, Mother's education = no answer, Life satisfaction = 5.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not answered and life satisfaction is less than 6)
- Respondent 28: Male, Mother's education = no answer, Life satisfaction = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not answered)
- Respondent 63: Male, Mother's education = 21.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent 103: Female, so does not meet the criteria
- Respondent 135: Male, Mother's education = 11.0, Life satisfaction = 10.0 (does not meet the criteria because mother's education is less than 16 years)

Therefore, there are 2 male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Laughter' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum their scores for 'Laughter' and 'Life satisfaction'. We then check if this sum equals 10 and count such occurrences.

Given the provided XML data, we can see the scores for 'Laughter' and 'Life satisfaction' for each respondent. Let's calculate the sum for each respondent:

1. Respondent 102: Laughter = 8.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Sum = 15.0
2. Respondent 80: Laughter = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Sum = 17.0
3. Respondent 87: Laughter = 6.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Sum = 13.0
4. Respondent 57: Laughter = 5.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Sum = 13.0
5. Respondent 86: Laughter = 3.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Sum = 11.0
6. Respondent 44: Laughter = 7.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Sum = 13.0
7. Respondent 20: Laughter = 7.0, Life satisfaction = 9.0, Sum = 16.0
8. Respondent 131: Laughter = 6.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0, Sum = 10.0

From the calculations above, only Respondent 131 has a total score for 'Laughter' and 'Life satisfaction' that equals 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is exactly 10.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 136: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6
2. Respondent 131: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 6, Total = 8
3. Respondent 50: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 9, Total = 10
4. Respondent 90: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 4, Total = 6
5. Respondent 38: Worry = 0, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 5
6. Respondent 61: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
7. Respondent 27: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
8. Respondent 66: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6

From the given data, only Respondent 50 has a total score of exactly 10 for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who meet the specified criteria.

First, we need to identify the female respondents. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Gender' question is a MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". So, we are looking for respondents with a 'Gender' answer of ""2.0"".

Next, we need to find the respondents whose mother has more than 18 years of education. The 'Parental Education' question has sub-questions for 'Father' and 'Mother', and the answer is an open-ended field. We need to find the respondents with a 'Mother' sub-answer greater than 18.

Finally, we need to find the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher. The 'Life satisfaction' question is a Likert scale with a range of 0-10, so we are looking for respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' answer of 6.0 or more.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents meet the specified criteria:

- Respondent 127: Female (Gender = 2.0), Mother's education = 27.0 (more than 18), Life satisfaction = 8.0 (6 or higher)
- Respondent 149: Not a match because Mother's education = 16.0 (not more than 18)
- Respondent 115: Not a match because Life satisfaction = 7.0 (6 or higher), but Mother's education = 28.0 (more than 18) and Gender = 2.0, so this respondent actually matches
- Respondent 119: Not a match because Mother's education = 11.0 (not more than 18)
- Respondent 145: Not a match because Life satisfaction = 8.0 (6 or higher), but Mother's education = 15.0 (not more than 18)

There are 2 respondents who meet the specified criteria: respondents 127 and 115, and also respondent 46 does not match because her life satisfaction is 6.0 but her mother's education is 16.0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents born in 2005 have a Loneliness greater than 5 and a Happiness less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the year of birth, Loneliness, and Happiness.

From the provided data, we can see the following respondents were born in 2005:
- Respondent 39
- Respondent 71
- Respondent 91
- Respondent 121

Now, let's check their Loneliness and Happiness scores:

- Respondent 39: Loneliness = 9.0, Happiness = 8.0 (Does not meet the Happiness criterion)
- Respondent 71: Loneliness = 8.0, Happiness = 5.0 (Meets both criteria)
- Respondent 91: Loneliness = 8.0, Happiness = 7.0 (Does not meet the Happiness criterion)
- Respondent 121: Loneliness = 4.0, Happiness = 7.0 (Does not meet the Loneliness criterion)

Only Respondent 71 meets the criteria of being born in 2005, having a Loneliness greater than 5, and a Happiness less than 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender and then compare each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average for their gender.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- The question ""Life satisfaction"" is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10.
- The question ""Gender"" is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female.

Let's calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender based on the 'responses' section:

1. For Male (Gender = 1.0):
   - Respondent 80: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 116: Life satisfaction = 6.0
   - Respondent 10: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 15: Life satisfaction = 7.0
   - Respondent 74: Life satisfaction = 3.0
   - Respondent 20: Life satisfaction = 9.0
   - Average for Male = (8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 3.0 + 9.0) / 6 = 41.0 / 6 = 6.83

2. For Female (Gender = 2.0):
   - Respondent 119: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Average for Female = 8.0 / 1 = 8.0

Now, let's identify respondents with a Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender:

1. For Male (average = 6.83):
   - Respondent 10: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (higher)
   - Respondent 20: Life satisfaction = 9.0 (higher)
   - Respondent 80: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (higher)
   - Respondent 15: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (higher)

2. For Female (average = 8.0):
   - No respondents have a Life satisfaction higher than 8.0.

Therefore, the number of respondents with a Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender is 4 (Respondents 10, 20, 80, and 15). 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Happiness that is higher than the average Happiness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Happiness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Happiness score to the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the question ""Happiness"" is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10, where 0 = ""At no time"" and 10 = ""All the time"". The question ""Gender"" is a multiple-choice question with options 1. Male and 2. Female.

Let's calculate the average Happiness for each gender based on the 'responses' section:

1. For Male (Gender = 1.0):
   - Respondent 130: Happiness = 8.0
   - Respondent 99: Happiness = 2.0
   - Respondent 119: Happiness = 7.0
   - Respondent 149: Happiness = 9.0
   - Respondent 11: Happiness = 5.0
   - Respondent 116: Happiness = 6.0
   - Total Happiness for Males = 8.0 + 2.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 = 37.0
   - Number of Males = 6
   - Average Happiness for Males = 37.0 / 6 = 6.17

2. For Female (Gender = 2.0):
   - Respondent 119: Happiness = 7.0
   - Respondent 142: Happiness = 5.0
   - Respondent 147: Happiness = 9.0
   - Total Happiness for Females = 7.0 + 5.0 + 9.0 = 21.0
   - Number of Females = 3
   - Average Happiness for Females = 21.0 / 3 = 7.0

Now, let's identify the respondents whose Happiness is higher than the average for their gender:

1. Males with Happiness > 6.17:
   - Respondent 130: Happiness = 8.0 (Higher)
   - Respondent 149: Happiness = 9.0 (Higher)
   - Respondent 119: Happiness = 7.0 (Higher)

2. Females with Happiness > 7.0:
   - Respondent 147: Happiness = 9.0 (Higher)

Count of respondents with Happiness higher than the average for their gender = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores of all 'Depressive Symptoms' sub-questions.

2. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group:**
   - Group respondents by their 'Socio-economic status'.
   - For each group, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

3. **Compare each respondent's score to their group's average:**
   - Count how many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's simplify the calculation process with an example based on the provided data, focusing on the critical steps and assumptions due to the format constraints.

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 83: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (2) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 8
- Respondent 122: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (1) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
- Respondent 129: Anhedonia (0) + Sleep Problems (2) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 3
- Respondent 39: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (0) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (2) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
- Respondent 16: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (2) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (2) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 7
- Respondent 116: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (1) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 4
- Respondent 27: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (3) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
- Respondent 88: Anhedonia (0) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (3) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 4
- Respondent 22: Anhedonia (2) + Sleep Problems (1) + Fatigue (3) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (1) + Concentration Difficulties (3) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 12

### Step 2: Group by 'Socio-economic status' and Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score

- Socio-economic status 2: Respondents 16, 27. Total scores: 7 (16), 5 (27). Average = (7 + 5) / 2 = 6
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondents 83, 122, 22, 116. Total scores: 8 (83), 5 (122), 12 (22), 4 (116). Average = (8 + 5 + 12 + 4) / 4 = 29 / 4 = 7.25
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondents 39, 88. Total scores: 5 (39), 4 (88). Average = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
- Socio-economic status 5: Respondent 129. Total score: 3. Average = 3

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average

- Socio-economic status 2: 
  - Respondent 16 (score 7) is equal to the average.
  - Respondent 27 (score 5) is lower than the average.
- Socio-economic status 3: 
  - Respondent 83 (score 8) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 122 (score 5) is lower than the average.
  - Respondent 22 (score 12) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 116 (score 4) is lower than the average.
- Socio-economic status 4: 
  - Respondent 39 (score 5) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 88 (score 4) is lower than the average.
- Socio-economic status 5: 
  - Respondent 129 (score 3) is the average, as there's only one respondent in this group.

### Count Respondents with Score Higher Than Average

- Respondent 22
- Respondent 39

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

To find the overall average 'Life satisfaction', we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

- Respondent 45: 10.0
- Respondent 11: 8.0
- Respondent 64: 7.0
- Respondent 113: 7.0
- Respondent 135: 10.0
- Respondent 134: 4.0
- Respondent 41: 8.0
- Respondent 94: 8.0
- Respondent 96: 10.0
- Respondent 73: 8.0
- Respondent 100: 8.0
- Respondent 105: 7.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 10.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 = 96.0

Total respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total respondents = 96.0 / 12 = 8.0

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

- Year 1993: Respondent 135 = 10.0 (1 respondent)
- Year 1998: Respondent 11 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- Year 1999: Respondent 100 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- Year 2001: Respondent 94 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- Year 2002: Respondents 45, 113, 105 = 10.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 = 24.0 (3 respondents)
- Year 2003: Respondents 134, 41, 73 = 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 = 20.0 (3 respondents)
- Year 2005: Respondents 64, 96 = 7.0 + 10.0 = 17.0 (2 respondents)

Average for 1993 = 10.0
Average for 1998 = 8.0
Average for 1999 = 8.0
Average for 2001 = 8.0
Average for 2002 = 24.0 / 3 = 8.0
Average for 2003 = 20.0 / 3 = 6.67
Average for 2005 = 17.0 / 2 = 8.5

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average:**

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than 8.0:
- 1993 (10.0)
- 2005 (8.5)

Respondents in these years:
- 1993: Respondent 135 (1 respondent)
- 2005: Respondents 64, 96 (2 respondents)

Total respondents = 1 (1993) + 2 (2005) = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",False

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 14: 3.0
- 86: 8.0
- 17: 10.0
- 85: 7.0
- 25: 8.0
- 143: 8.0
- 99: 5.0
- 73: 8.0
- 65: 8.0
- 39: 9.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 3.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 = 80.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 80.0 / 10 = 8.0

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth:**

Years of birth and their corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 2002: 3.0 (Respondent 14)
- 2004: 8.0 (Respondent 86)
- 1999: 10.0 (Respondent 17)
- 2003: 7.0 (Respondent 85), 8.0 (Respondent 73) => Average for 2003 = (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.5
- 2001: 8.0 (Respondent 25), 5.0 (Respondent 99) => Average for 2001 = (8.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 6.5
- 2005: 8.0 (Respondent 143), 8.0 (Respondent 65), 9.0 (Respondent 39) => Average for 2005 = (8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 8.33

3. **Count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average (8.0):**

- 2005 average is 8.33, which is greater than 8.0. Respondents 143, 65, and 39 were born in 2005. That's 3 respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Loneliness that is higher than the average Loneliness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Loneliness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Loneliness score to the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. The ""Loneliness"" question is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the average Loneliness for each gender based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Male (Gender = 1)**:
   - Respondent 21: Loneliness = 10.0
   - Respondent 150: Loneliness = 6.0
   - Respondent 90: Loneliness = 8.0
   - Respondent 80: Loneliness = 2.0
   - Respondent 34: Loneliness = 0.0
   - Respondent 22: Loneliness = 0.0
   - Respondent 97: Loneliness = 10.0

   Total Loneliness for Males = 10.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 10.0 = 36.0
   Number of Males = 7
   Average Loneliness for Males = 36.0 / 7 = 5.143 (rounded to three decimal places for calculation purposes)

2. **Female (Gender = 2)**:
   - Respondent 21: Loneliness = 10.0
   - Respondent 37: Loneliness = 3.0
   - Respondent 101: Loneliness = 2.0
   - Respondent 144: Loneliness = 6.0

   Total Loneliness for Females = 10.0 + 3.0 + 2.0 + 6.0 = 21.0
   Number of Females = 4
   Average Loneliness for Females = 21.0 / 4 = 5.25

Now, let's identify respondents with Loneliness higher than the average for their gender:

- **Males** with Loneliness > 5.143:
  - Respondent 21: 10.0
  - Respondent 90: 8.0
  - Respondent 150: 6.0
  - Respondent 97: 10.0

- **Females** with Loneliness > 5.25:
  - Respondent 21: 10.0
  - Respondent 144: 6.0

Counting these respondents:
- Males: 4
- Females: 2
Total respondents with Loneliness higher than the average for their gender = 4 + 2 = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

To find the overall average, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 33: 5.0
- 135: 10.0
- 24: 8.0
- 109: 9.0
- 131: 4.0
- 93: 8.0
- 5: 5.0
- 80: 8.0
- 47: 8.0
- 55: 10.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 = 75.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 75.0 / 10 = 7.5

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth:**

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 1993: 10.0 (1 respondent)
- 2002: 8.0 (1 respondent)
- 2003: 8.0, 4.0, 8.0, 5.0, 10.0 (5 respondents)
- 2004: 5.0, 8.0 (2 respondents)

Average for 1993 = 10.0
Average for 2002 = 8.0
Average for 2003 = (8.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 10.0) / 5 = 35.0 / 5 = 7.0
Average for 2004 = (5.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5

3. **Count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average (7.5):**

- 1993 average is 10.0, which is greater than 7.5. (1 respondent)
- 2002 average is 8.0, which is not greater than 7.5. (0 respondents)
- 2003 average is 7.0, which is not greater than 7.5. (0 respondents)
- 2004 average is 6.5, which is not greater than 7.5. (0 respondents)

Total respondents in years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent**: This involves summing up the scores for all 'Depressive Symptoms' questions for each respondent.

2. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' of each respondent**: This is directly given in the responses.

3. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group**: Group the respondents by 'Socio-economic status', sum up their 'Depressive Symptoms' scores, and divide by the number of respondents in each group.

4. **Compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their 'Socio-economic status' group**: Count how many respondents have a score higher than the average of their group.

Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step calculations based on the provided data, let's simplify the approach by directly calculating the necessary values:

- **Step 1 & 2**: Calculate total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent and identify their 'Socio-economic status'.

- **Step 3**: Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group.

- **Step 4**: Compare and count.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Respondents' Data

1. **Respondent 125**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
   - 'Socio-economic status': 1.0

2. **Respondent 50**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 1 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
   - 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

3. **Respondent 58**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
   - 'Socio-economic status': 1.0

4. **Respondent 36**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
   - 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

5. **Respondent 40**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 2 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 3 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 11

   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 1
   - 'Socio-economic status': 6.0

7. **Respondent 76**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 2 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 3 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8
   - 'Socio-economic status': 2.0

8. **Respondent 26**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 2 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 2 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 2 (Concentration Difficulties) + 1 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12
   - 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

9. **Respondent 130**:
   - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 0
   - 'Socio-economic status': 6.0

10. **Respondent 139**:
    - 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 3 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8
    - 'Socio-economic status': 5.0

### Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score by 'Socio-economic status'

- **Socio-economic status 1.0**: (4 + 4 + 11) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- **Socio-economic status 2.0**: 8 / 1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status 3.0**: (2 + 2 + 12) / 3 = 16 / 3 = 5.33
- **Socio-economic status 5.0**: 8 / 1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status 6.0**: (1 + 0) / 2 = 1 / 2 = 0.5

### Comparison

- **Respondent 125**: Score 4, Average for group 6.33, Lower
- **Respondent 50**: Score 2, Average for group 5.33, Lower
- **Respondent 58**: Score 4, Average for group 6.33, Lower
- **Respondent 36**: Score 2, Average for group 5.33, Lower
- **Respondent 40**: Score 11, Average for group 6.33, Higher
- **Respondent 20**: Score 1, Average for group 0.5, Higher
- **Respondent 76**: Score 8, Average for group 8, Equal
- **Respondent 26**: Score 12, Average for group 5.33, Higher
- **Respondent 130**: Score 0, Average for group 0.5, Lower
- **Respondent 139**: Score 8, Average for group 8, Equal

### Count of Respondents with Higher Score than Average

From the comparison:
- **Respondent 40** (Score 11, Group average 6.33)
- **Respondent 20** (Score 1, Group average 0.5)
- **Respondent 26** (Score 12, Group average 5.33)

Therefore, the number of respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group is **3**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 8 + 7 + 10 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 105
   - Number of respondents = 15
   - Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Number of respondents = 105 / 15 = 7

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and compare:**

   - **2001:** 1 respondent with 'Life satisfaction' = 8. Average = 8.
   - **2002:** 4 respondents with 'Life satisfaction' = 6 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 26. Average = 26 / 4 = 6.5.
   - **2003:** 3 respondents with 'Life satisfaction' = 7 + 8 + 8 = 23. Average = 23 / 3 = 7.67.
   - **2004:** 2 respondents with 'Life satisfaction' = 8 + 6 = 14. Average = 14 / 2 = 7.
   - **2005:** 2 respondents with 'Life satisfaction' = 8 + 7 = 15. Average = 15 / 2 = 7.5.

3. **Count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average (7):**

   - **2001:** 1 respondent (average = 8 > 7)
   - **2003:** 3 respondents (average = 7.67 > 7)
   - **2005:** 2 respondents (average = 7.5 > 7)

Total respondents = 1 (2001) + 3 (2003) + 2 (2005) = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Anger that is higher than the average Anger for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Anger for each gender and then compare each respondent's Anger level to this average based on their gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the question ""Anger"" is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10, where 0 = ""At no time"" and 10 = ""All the time"". The question ""Gender"" is a multiple-choice question with options 1. Male and 2. Female.

Let's calculate the average Anger for each gender based on the 'responses' section:

1. For Male (Gender = 1.0):
   - Respondent 114: Anger = 1.0
   - Respondent 73: Anger = 1.0
   - Respondent 137: Anger = 2.0
   - Respondent 80: Anger = 4.0
   - Respondent 121: Anger = 1.0
   - Total Anger for Males = 1.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 4.0 + 1.0 = 9.0
   - Number of Males = 5
   - Average Anger for Males = 9.0 / 5 = 1.8

2. For Female (Gender = 2.0):
   - Respondent 115: Anger = 3.0
   - Respondent 62: Anger = 4.0
   - Respondent 50: Anger = 2.0
   - Total Anger for Females = 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 = 9.0
   - Number of Females = 3
   - Average Anger for Females = 9.0 / 3 = 3.0

Now, let's identify respondents with Anger higher than the average for their gender:

- Males with Anger > 1.8: 
  - Respondent 137: Anger = 2.0 (higher)
  - Respondent 80: Anger = 4.0 (higher)
  
- Females with Anger > 3.0: 
  - Respondent 62: Anger = 4.0 (higher)

Therefore, the number of respondents with Anger higher than the average Anger for their gender is 3.",True
