</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses, which corresponds to question 2 in the schema: ""2. Gender: What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

From the responses provided:

- Respondent 148: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 76: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 6: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 102: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 71: Gender: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 3: Gender: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 145: Gender: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 13: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 128: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 74: Gender: 1.0 (Male)

Counting the number of respondents with Gender: 1.0 (which corresponds to Male according to the schema), we find:

1. Respondent 148
2. Respondent 76
3. Respondent 6
4. Respondent 102

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses, which corresponds to question 2 in the schema: ""2. Gender: What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

From the responses provided:

- Respondent 102: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 143: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 94: Gender: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 24: Gender: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 4: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 68: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 138: Gender: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 32: Gender: 1.0 (Male)

Therefore, the female respondents are Respondent 94 and Respondent 24.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are male?
</task>","To determine the number of male respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses, which corresponds to question 2 in the schema: ""2. Gender: What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses, which corresponds to question 2 in the schema: ""2. Gender: What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

We then need to count the number of responses where the gender is listed as ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"" according to the schema.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 14: Gender: 2.0
- Respondent 27: Gender: 2.0

There are 2 respondents who are female. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents born in 2003 have a Worry greater than 4 and a Laughter less than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the year of birth, Worry, and Laughter values.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 87: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 2, Laughter = 6. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4 and Laughter is not less than 6.
- Respondent 47: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 1, Laughter = 5. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4.
- Respondent 8: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 2, Laughter = 7. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4 and Laughter is not less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data and calculate the total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'. We are looking for respondents where this total score equals exactly 11.

Let's calculate this for each respondent:

1. Respondent 95: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8 (does not meet the criteria)
2. Respondent 80: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 2, Total = 10 (does not meet the criteria)
3. Respondent 84: Life satisfaction = 9, Depression = 0, Total = 9 (does not meet the criteria)
4. Respondent 146: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 2, Total = 9 (does not meet the criteria)
5. Respondent 22: Life satisfaction = 6, Depression = 1, Total = 7 (does not meet the criteria)
6. Respondent 14: Life satisfaction = 3, Depression = 3, Total = 6 (does not meet the criteria)
7. Respondent 40: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 3, Total = 11 (meets the criteria)

After reviewing all the respondents, only Respondent 40 has a total score of exactly 11 for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the following conditions:
1. The respondent is male (Gender: 1.0).
2. The respondent's mother has more than 16 years of education.
3. The respondent has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

Let's go through the respondents:

- Respondent 56: Gender = 2.0 (Female), so this respondent does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent 132: Gender = 2.0 (Female), so this respondent does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent 30: Gender = 1.0 (Male), Mother's education = 16.0 (does not exceed 16 years), so this respondent does not meet the second condition.
- Respondent 89: Gender = 1.0 (Male), Mother's education = 15.0 (does not exceed 16 years), so this respondent does not meet the second condition.
- Respondent 111: Gender = 1.0 (Male), but Mother's education is not provided, so we cannot determine if this respondent meets the second condition.
- Respondent 29: Gender = 1.0 (Male), Mother's education = 7.0 (does not exceed 16 years), so this respondent does not meet the second condition.
- Respondent 73: Gender = 1.0 (Male), Mother's education = 37.0 (exceeds 16 years), Life satisfaction = 8.0 (meets the third condition). This respondent meets all conditions.
- Respondent 125: Gender = 1.0 (Male), but Mother's education is not provided, so we cannot determine if this respondent meets the second condition.
- Respondent 135: Gender = 1.0 (Male), Mother's education = 11.0 (does not exceed 16 years), so this respondent does not meet the second condition.
- Respondent 79: Gender = 2.0 (Female), so this respondent does not meet the first condition.

Only Respondent 73 meets all the specified conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We are interested in the female respondents, so we will look for respondents with a 'Gender' score of 2.0.

We also know that the 'Parental Education' field has subfields for 'Father' and 'Mother', and we are interested in the 'Mother' subfield. We will look for respondents with a 'Mother' score greater than 18.

Finally, we know that the 'Life satisfaction' field is a Likert scale with scores ranging from 0 to 10, and we are interested in respondents with a score of 7 or higher.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found the following female respondents who meet the criteria:

* Respondent 15: Gender = 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 2: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 11.0 (less than 18), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 36: Gender = 2.0 (Female), but there is no information about the mother's education, so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 55: Gender = 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 57: Gender = 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 78: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 25.0 (more than 18), Life satisfaction = 9.0 (7 or higher), so this respondent meets the criteria.
* Respondent 102: Gender = 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
* Respondent 53: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 5.0 (less than 18), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, there is only 1 female respondent who has a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' is exactly 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data and calculate the total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression'. We are looking for respondents where this total score equals exactly 8.

1. Respondent 75: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1, Total = 10
2. Respondent 84: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
3. Respondent 31: Happiness = 6, Depression = 3, Total = 9
4. Respondent 2: Happiness = 7, Depression = 0, Total = 7
5. Respondent 128: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
6. Respondent 111: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0, Total = 8
7. Respondent 45: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1, Total = 10
8. Respondent 34: Happiness = 10, Depression = 0, Total = 10
9. Respondent 98: Happiness = 5, Depression = 0, Total = 5
10. Respondent 137: Happiness = 7, Depression = 1, Total = 8

From the calculations above, the respondents with a total score of exactly 8 for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' are:

- Respondent 84
- Respondent 128
- Respondent 111
- Respondent 137

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' is exactly 8 is 4.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 11.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' and count those where the sum of these two scores equals 11.

From the provided responses:

- Respondent 81: Stress = 4, Life satisfaction = 4. Total = 8.
- Respondent 148: Stress = 2, Life satisfaction = 7. Total = 9.
- Respondent 110: Stress = 3, Life satisfaction = 8. Total = 11.
- Respondent 147: Stress = 2, Life satisfaction = 9. Total = 11.
- Respondent 104: Stress = 1, Life satisfaction = 8. Total = 9.
- Respondent 107: Stress = 3, Life satisfaction = 6. Total = 9.
- Respondent 75: Stress = 3, Life satisfaction = 8. Total = 11.
- Respondent 30: Stress = 3, Life satisfaction = 10. Total = 13.

The respondents with a total score of exactly 11 for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' are Respondent 110, Respondent 147, and Respondent 75.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Stress' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 11 is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- The 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female.
- The 'Parental Education' field has subfields 'Father' and 'Mother', which are open-ended.
- The 'Life satisfaction' field is a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Analyzing the 'responses' section:
- Respondent 6: Male, Mother's education not specified, Life satisfaction 6.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not specified.
- Respondent 84: Male, Mother's education 16.0, Life satisfaction 9.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is exactly 16 years, not more than 16.
- Respondent 44: Female, Mother's education 17.0, Life satisfaction 6.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is female.
- Respondent 118: Female, Mother's education 11.0, Life satisfaction 6.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is female and mother's education is less than 16 years.
- Respondent 93: Male, Mother's education 12.0, Life satisfaction 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is less than 16 years.
- Respondent 23: Male, Mother's education 25.0, Life satisfaction 6.0. Meets the criteria.
- Respondent 112: Male, Mother's education not specified, Life satisfaction 5.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not specified and life satisfaction is less than 6.
- Respondent 28: Male, Mother's education not specified, Life satisfaction 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is not specified.
- Respondent 63: Male, Mother's education 21.0, Life satisfaction 8.0. Meets the criteria.
- Respondent 103: Female, Mother's education 19.0, Life satisfaction 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is female.
- Respondent 135: Male, Mother's education 11.0, Life satisfaction 10.0. Does not meet the criteria because mother's education is less than 16 years.

Therefore, the male respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent 23 and Respondent 63.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for the 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' scores, add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 10.

Let's go through the respondents one by one:

1. Respondent 136: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6
2. Respondent 131: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 6, Total = 8
3. Respondent 50: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 9, Total = 10
4. Respondent 90: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 4, Total = 6
5. Respondent 38: Worry = 0, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 5
6. Respondent 61: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
7. Respondent 27: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
8. Respondent 66: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6

From the given data, only Respondent 50 has a total score of exactly 10 for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the following conditions:
1. The respondent is female (Gender: 2.0, as per the schema).
2. The respondent's mother has more than 18 years of education.
3. The respondent has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

Let's go through the respondents:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

From the provided data:

- Respondent 39 was born in 2005, with a Loneliness score of 9.0 and a Happiness score of 8.0. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Happiness score is not less than 4.
- Respondent 71 was born in 2005, with a Loneliness score of 8.0 and a Happiness score of 5.0. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Happiness score is not less than 4.
- Respondent 91 was born in 2005, with a Loneliness score of 8.0 and a Happiness score of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Happiness score is not less than 4.
- Respondent 121 was born in 2005, with a Loneliness score of 4.0 and a Happiness score of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Loneliness score is not greater than 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender?
</task>","To determine how many respondents have a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender, we first need to calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender.

From the provided data:

- Male (Gender: 1.0) respondents and their Life satisfaction scores are:
  - Respondent 80: 8.0
  - Respondent 116: 6.0
  - Respondent 10: 8.0
  - Respondent 15: 7.0
  - Respondent 74: 3.0
  - Respondent 20: 9.0
- Female (Gender: 2.0) respondents and their Life satisfaction scores are:
  - Respondent 119: 8.0

Calculating the average Life satisfaction for males:
(8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 3.0 + 9.0) / 6 = 41.0 / 6 = 6.8333

Calculating the average Life satisfaction for females:
Since there's only one female respondent, the average is 8.0.

Now, comparing each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average for their gender:

- Males:
  - Respondent 80: 8.0 > 6.8333 (Yes)
  - Respondent 116: 6.0 < 6.8333 (No)
  - Respondent 10: 8.0 > 6.8333 (Yes)
  - Respondent 15: 7.0 > 6.8333 (Yes)
  - Respondent 74: 3.0 < 6.8333 (No)
  - Respondent 20: 9.0 > 6.8333 (Yes)
- Females:
  - Respondent 119: 8.0 = 8.0 (No, since it's not higher)

Counting the respondents with Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender:
- Males: 4 (Respondents 80, 10, 15, 20)
- Females: 0

Therefore, the total number of respondents with a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Happiness that is higher than the average Happiness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Happiness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Happiness score to this average.

From the data provided:

- Male (Gender 1.0) respondents and their Happiness scores are:
  - Respondent 130: 8.0
  - Respondent 99: 2.0
  - Respondent 119: 7.0
  - Respondent 149: 9.0
  - Respondent 11: 5.0
  - Respondent 116: 6.0

- Female (Gender 2.0) respondents and their Happiness scores are:
  - Respondent 119: 7.0
  - Respondent 142: 5.0
  - Respondent 147: 9.0

Calculating the average Happiness for each gender:

- For Males: (8.0 + 2.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0) / 6 = 37.0 / 6 = 6.17 (rounded to two decimal places)
- For Females: (7.0 + 5.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 21.0 / 3 = 7.0

Now, comparing each respondent's Happiness score to the average for their gender:

- Males with Happiness higher than 6.17: 
  - Respondent 130: 8.0 (higher)
  - Respondent 119: 7.0 (lower, but since 7.0 is exactly the average for females and this respondent is male, it's actually lower than the male average)
  - Respondent 149: 9.0 (higher)
  - Respondent 11: 5.0 (lower)
  - Respondent 116: 6.0 (lower)

- Females with Happiness higher than 7.0:
  - Respondent 119: Not actually a female respondent, mistake in previous step. Correct female respondents are:
  - Respondent 142: 5.0 (lower)
  - Respondent 147: 9.0 (higher)
  - And actually, Respondent 119 is a female respondent with Happiness: 7.0 (equal, not higher)

Correcting the assessment based on accurate gender identification for each respondent:

- Male respondents with Happiness higher than the male average (6.17):
  - Respondent 130: 8.0
  - Respondent 149: 9.0

- Female respondents with Happiness higher than the female average (7.0):
  - Respondent 147: 9.0

Therefore, the number of respondents with a Happiness score higher than the average for their gender is 3.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - Respondent 83: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (2) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 8
   - Respondent 122: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (1) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
   - Respondent 129: Anhedonia (0) + Sleep Problems (2) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 3
   - Respondent 39: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (0) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (2) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
   - Respondent 16: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (2) + Fatigue (2) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (2) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 7
   - Respondent 116: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (1) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (1) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 4
   - Respondent 27: Anhedonia (1) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (0) + Feelings of Worthlessness (3) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 5
   - Respondent 88: Anhedonia (0) + Sleep Problems (0) + Fatigue (1) + Appetite Changes (3) + Feelings of Worthlessness (0) + Concentration Difficulties (0) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 4
   - Respondent 22: Anhedonia (2) + Sleep Problems (1) + Fatigue (3) + Appetite Changes (2) + Feelings of Worthlessness (1) + Concentration Difficulties (3) + Suicidal Thoughts (0) = 12

2. **Group Respondents by 'Socio-economic status' and Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score:**
   - Socio-economic status 2.0: Respondents 16, 27. Total scores = 7 (16) + 5 (27) = 12. Average = 12 / 2 = 6
   - Socio-economic status 3.0: Respondents 83, 122, 116, 22. Total scores = 8 (83) + 5 (122) + 4 (116) + 12 (22) = 29. Average = 29 / 4 = 7.25
   - Socio-economic status 4.0: Respondents 39, 88. Total scores = 5 (39) + 4 (88) = 9. Average = 9 / 2 = 4.5
   - Socio-economic status 5.0: Respondent 129. Total score = 3. Average = 3

3. **Determine How Many Respondents Have a 'Depressive Symptoms' Score Higher Than the Average for Their 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - Socio-economic status 2.0: Respondent 16 (score 7) is above the average (6), and Respondent 27 (score 5) is below. So, 1 respondent.
   - Socio-economic status 3.0: Respondents 83 (score 8) is above the average (7.25), Respondent 122 (score 5) is below, Respondent 116 (score 4) is below, and Respondent 22 (score 12) is above. So, 2 respondents.
   - Socio-economic status 4.0: Respondent 39 (score 5) is above the average (4.5), and Respondent 88 (score 4) is below. So, 1 respondent.
   - Socio-economic status 5.0: Since there's only one respondent, and their score is the average, no one is above the average.

**Total Respondents with a Score Higher Than the Average for Their Group:** 1 (from status 2.0) + 2 (from status 3.0) + 1 (from status 4.0) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 45: 10.0
   - Respondent 11: 8.0
   - Respondent 64: 7.0
   - Respondent 113: 7.0
   - Respondent 135: 10.0
   - Respondent 134: 4.0
   - Respondent 41: 8.0
   - Respondent 94: 8.0
   - Respondent 96: 10.0
   - Respondent 73: 8.0
   - Respondent 100: 8.0
   - Respondent 105: 7.0

   Overall average = (10.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0) / 12
   Overall average = 96.0 / 12
   Overall average = 8.0

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

   - 1993: Respondent 135 = 10.0
   - 1998: Respondent 11 = 8.0
   - 1999: Respondent 100 = 8.0
   - 2001: Respondent 94 = 8.0
   - 2002: Respondents 45, 105 = (10.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 8.5
   - 2003: Respondents 41, 73, 134 = (8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0) / 3 = 6.67
   - 2005: Respondents 64, 96 = (7.0 + 10.0) / 2 = 8.5

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (8.0):**

   - 1993: 1 respondent (Respondent 135)
   - 1998: Does not exceed overall average
   - 1999: Does not exceed overall average
   - 2001: Does not exceed overall average
   - 2002: Exceeds overall average, 2 respondents (Respondents 45, 105)
   - 2003: Does not exceed overall average
   - 2005: Exceeds overall average, 2 respondents (Respondents 64, 96)

Total respondents = 1 (1993) + 2 (2002) + 2 (2005) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 14: Life satisfaction = 3.0
   - Respondent 86: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 17: Life satisfaction = 10.0
   - Respondent 85: Life satisfaction = 7.0
   - Respondent 25: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 143: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5.0
   - Respondent 73: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 65: Life satisfaction = 8.0
   - Respondent 39: Life satisfaction = 9.0

   Overall average = (3.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0) / 10 = 78.0 / 10 = 7.8

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and identify years with an average greater than 7.8:**

   - Year 2002: Respondent 14 = 3.0 (Average = 3.0)
   - Year 2004: Respondent 86 = 8.0 (Average = 8.0)
   - Year 1999: Respondent 17 = 10.0 (Average = 10.0)
   - Year 2003: Respondents 85 = 7.0, 73 = 8.0 (Average = (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.5)
   - Year 2001: Respondents 25 = 8.0, 99 = 5.0 (Average = (8.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 6.5)
   - Year 2005: Respondents 143 = 8.0, 65 = 8.0, 39 = 9.0 (Average = (8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 8.33)

   Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than 7.8: 1999, 2005

3. **Count the respondents born in these years:**

   - 1999: 1 respondent (Respondent 17)
   - 2005: 3 respondents (Respondent 143, 65, 39)

Total respondents = 1 (1999) + 3 (2005) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Loneliness that is higher than the average Loneliness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Loneliness for each gender and then compare each respondent's Loneliness score to the average for their gender.

From the responses:

- Male (Gender: 1.0) respondents and their Loneliness scores: 
  - Respondent 21: Not Male
  - Respondent 150: 6.0
  - Respondent 37: Not Male
  - Respondent 90: 8.0
  - Respondent 80: 2.0
  - Respondent 101: Not Male
  - Respondent 34: 0.0
  - Respondent 22: 0.0
  - Respondent 144: Not Male
  - Respondent 97: 10.0

  Male respondents' Loneliness scores: 6.0, 8.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0
  Average Loneliness for Males = (6.0 + 8.0 + 2.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 10.0) / 6 = 26.0 / 6 = 4.33

- Female (Gender: 2.0) respondents and their Loneliness scores:
  - Respondent 21: 10.0
  - Respondent 150: Not Female
  - Respondent 37: 3.0
  - Respondent 90: Not Female
  - Respondent 80: Not Female
  - Respondent 101: 2.0
  - Respondent 34: Not Female
  - Respondent 22: Not Female
  - Respondent 144: 6.0
  - Respondent 97: Not Female

  Female respondents' Loneliness scores: 10.0, 3.0, 2.0, 6.0
  Average Loneliness for Females = (10.0 + 3.0 + 2.0 + 6.0) / 4 = 21.0 / 4 = 5.25

Now, comparing each respondent's Loneliness score to the average for their gender:

- Male respondents:
  - Respondent 150: 6.0 (higher than 4.33)
  - Respondent 90: 8.0 (higher than 4.33)
  - Respondent 80: 2.0 (lower than 4.33)
  - Respondent 34: 0.0 (lower than 4.33)
  - Respondent 22: 0.0 (lower than 4.33)
  - Respondent 97: 10.0 (higher than 4.33)

- Female respondents:
  - Respondent 21: 10.0 (higher than 5.25)
  - Respondent 37: 3.0 (lower than 5.25)
  - Respondent 101: 2.0 (lower than 5.25)
  - Respondent 144: 6.0 (higher than 5.25)

Respondents with Loneliness higher than the average for their gender:
- Male: Respondent 150, Respondent 90, Respondent 97
- Female: Respondent 21, Respondent 144

Total number of respondents with Loneliness higher than the average for their gender: 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 33: 5.0
   - Respondent 135: 10.0
   - Respondent 24: 8.0
   - Respondent 109: 9.0
   - Respondent 131: 4.0
   - Respondent 93: 8.0
   - Respondent 5: 5.0
   - Respondent 80: 8.0
   - Respondent 47: 8.0
   - Respondent 55: 10.0

   Overall average = (5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0) / 10 = 75.0 / 10 = 7.5

2. **Calculate average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth:**

   - Year 1993: Respondent 135 = 10.0
   - Year 2002: Respondent 80 = 8.0
   - Year 2003: Respondents 109, 131, 93, 5, 47, 55 = (9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 10.0) / 6 = 44.0 / 6 = 7.333...
   - Year 2004: Respondents 33, 24 = (5.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5

3. **Identify years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average (7.5):**

   - Year 1993: 10.0 > 7.5
   - Year 2003: 7.333... < 7.5 (does not meet the criteria)
   - Year 2002: 8.0 > 7.5

4. **Count respondents born in those years:**

   - Year 1993: 1 respondent (135)
   - Year 2002: 1 respondent (80)

Therefore, the total number of respondents born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction' is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent:**
   - This involves summing up the scores for 'Anhedonia', 'Depressed Mood', 'Sleep Problems', 'Fatigue', 'Appetite Changes', 'Feelings of Worthlessness', 'Concentration Difficulties', 'Psychomotor Changes', and 'Suicidal Thoughts' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' group for each respondent:**
   - This is directly given in the responses.

3. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group:**
   - Group the respondents by their 'Socio-economic status'.
   - For each group, sum up all the 'Depressive Symptoms' scores and divide by the number of respondents in that group.

4. **Compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to their group's average:**
   - Count how many respondents have a 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step calculations for each respondent and each 'Socio-economic status' group, let's proceed with the calculations based on the provided data:

### Respondent 125:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- 'Socio-economic status': 1.0

### Respondent 50:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 1 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
- 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

### Respondent 58:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- 'Socio-economic status': 1.0

### Respondent 36:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
- 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

### Respondent 40:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 2 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 3 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 11
- 'Socio-economic status': 1.0

### Respondent 20:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 1
- 'Socio-economic status': 6.0

### Respondent 76:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 2 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 3 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8
- 'Socio-economic status': 2.0

### Respondent 26:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 1 (Anhedonia) + 2 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 2 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 2 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 1 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12
- 'Socio-economic status': 3.0

### Respondent 130:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 0
- 'Socio-economic status': 6.0

### Respondent 139:
- 'Depressive Symptoms' score: 3 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8
- 'Socio-economic status': 5.0

**Socio-economic status groups and their average 'Depressive Symptoms' scores:**

- **Status 1.0:** Respondents 125, 58, 40. Total score = 4 + 4 + 11 = 19. Average = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- **Status 2.0:** Respondent 76. Total score = 8. Average = 8 / 1 = 8
- **Status 3.0:** Respondents 50, 36, 26. Total score = 2 + 2 + 12 = 16. Average = 16 / 3 = 5.33
- **Status 5.0:** Respondent 139. Total score = 8. Average = 8 / 1 = 8
- **Status 6.0:** Respondents 20, 130. Total score = 1 + 0 = 1. Average = 1 / 2 = 0.5

**Comparing each respondent's score to their group's average:**

- **Status 1.0:** 
  - Respondent 125 (score 4) is below the average.
  - Respondent 58 (score 4) is below the average.
  - Respondent 40 (score 11) is above the average.
- **Status 2.0:** 
  - Respondent 76 (score 8) is equal to the average.
- **Status 3.0:** 
  - Respondent 50 (score 2) is below the average.
  - Respondent 36 (score 2) is below the average.
  - Respondent 26 (score 12) is above the average.
- **Status 5.0:** 
  - Respondent 139 (score 8) is equal to the average.
- **Status 6.0:** 
  - Respondent 20 (score 1) is above the average.
  - Respondent 130 (score 0) is below the average.

**Count of respondents with a score higher than their group's average:**

- Respondent 40
- Respondent 26
- Respondent 20

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 10: 8.0
   - Respondent 87: 7.0
   - Respondent 34: 10.0
   - Respondent 97: 6.0
   - Respondent 40: 8.0
   - Respondent 42: 8.0
   - Respondent 47: 8.0
   - Respondent 43: 7.0
   - Respondent 113: 7.0
   - Respondent 12: 6.0
   - Respondent 106: 5.0
   - Respondent 94: 8.0

   Overall average = (8.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 8.0) / 12
   Overall average = 84.0 / 12
   Overall average = 7.0

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth:**

   - Year 2001: Respondent 94 = 8.0
   - Year 2002: Respondents 10, 97, 106, 113 = (8.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 7.0) / 4 = 26.0 / 4 = 6.5
   - Year 2003: Respondents 87, 34, 47 = (7.0 + 10.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 25.0 / 3 = 8.33
   - Year 2004: Respondents 40, 12 = (8.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 14.0 / 2 = 7.0
   - Year 2005: Respondents 42, 43 = (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5

3. **Count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year is greater than the overall average (7.0):**

   - Year 2003: Average = 8.33, Respondents = 87, 34, 47 (3 respondents)
   - Year 2005: Average = 7.5, Respondents = 42, 43 (2 respondents)

Total respondents = 3 (from 2003) + 2 (from 2005) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Anger that is higher than the average Anger for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Anger for each gender and then compare each respondent's Anger level to this average.

From the responses:

- Male (Gender: 1.0) respondents and their Anger levels: 
  - Respondent 114: 1.0
  - Respondent 73: 1.0
  - Respondent 60: 3.0
  - Respondent 80: 4.0
  - Respondent 137: 2.0
  - Respondent 121: 1.0

- Female (Gender: 2.0) respondents and their Anger levels:
  - Respondent 115: 3.0
  - Respondent 62: 4.0
  - Respondent 50: 2.0

Calculating the average Anger for each gender:

- Average Anger for Males: (1.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 + 1.0) / 6 = 12.0 / 6 = 2.0
- Average Anger for Females: (3.0 + 4.0 + 2.0) / 3 = 9.0 / 3 = 3.0

Now, comparing each respondent's Anger level to the average for their gender:

- Males with Anger higher than the average (2.0):
  - Respondent 60: 3.0
  - Respondent 80: 4.0

- Females with Anger higher than the average (3.0):
  - Respondent 62: 4.0

Counting the respondents with Anger higher than the average for their gender: 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
