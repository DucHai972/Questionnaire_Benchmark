</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  male respondents born before 2004.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the male respondents and their year of birth from the given responses.


From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Gender"" field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female.
- The ""Year of birth"" field is an open-ended question.


We will go through each respondent's data in the 'responses' section to find males born before 2004.


Respondent 71: Female, born 2005
Respondent 108: Female, born 2001 (Meets the criteria)
Respondent 77: Male, born 2002 (Meets the criteria)
Respondent 124: Male, born 2005
Respondent 20: Male, born 2003 (Meets the criteria)
Respondent 93: Male, born 2003 (Meets the criteria)
Respondent 65: Male, born 2005
Respondent 64: Female, born 2005
Respondent 127: Female, born 2004
Respondent 51: Female, born 2002
Respondent 118: Female, born 2005


The male respondents born before 2004 are:
77, 20, 93, 108 does not meet the gender criteria, so we exclude it.


The final answer is: $\boxed{77, 20, 93}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

- The ""Year of birth"" question is an open-ended question.


Looking at the 'responses' section, we can identify the following female respondents (Gender: 2.0) born before 2002:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the respondents who are female and were born before 2002.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" is an open-ended question that directly provides the year of birth.
- The ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female.

We are looking for female respondents, which corresponds to option 2.0 in the responses.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find females born before 2002:

- Respondent 118: Female (2.0), born in 2005.0, which is after 2002.
- Respondent 45: Male (1.0), born in 2002.0, so not a female and exactly born in 2002, not before.
- Respondent 77: Male (1.0), born in 2002.0, so not a female and exactly born in 2002, not before.
- Respondent 22: Male (1.0), born in 2003.0, which is after 2002 and not female.
- Respondent 35: Female (2.0), born in 2001.0, which is before 2002.
- Respondent 81: Female (2.0), born in 2002.0, so exactly born in 2002, not before.
- Respondent 31: Female (2.0), born in 2002.0, so exactly born in 2002, not before.
- Respondent 62: Female (2.0), born in 2003.0, which is after 2002.
- Respondent 79: Female (2.0), born in 2004.0, which is after 2002.
- Respondent 30: Male (1.0), born in 2002.0, so not a female and exactly born in 2002, not before.

The only female respondent born before 2002 is Respondent 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which  female respondents born after 2004 have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section and apply the filters as specified:

1. **Female respondents**: We are looking for respondents with `Gender: 2.0`, as per the schema, `2.0` corresponds to `Female`.
2. **Born after 2004**: We need to find respondents with a `Year of birth` greater than 2004.
3. **'Life satisfaction' score of 6**: The `Life satisfaction` score must be exactly 6.
4. **'Depression' score of less than 4**: The `Depression` score must be less than 4.

Let's go through the respondents and apply these filters:

- Respondent 44: Female, born in 2003, so not after 2004.
- Respondent 118: Female, born in 2005, `Life satisfaction` is 6, and `Depression` is 1, which meets the criteria.
- Respondent 145: Female, born in 2022, `Life satisfaction` is 8, so does not meet the `Life satisfaction` criteria.
- Respondent 127: Female, born in 2004, so not after 2004.
- Respondent 141: Female, born in 2004, so not after 2004.
- Respondent 131: Female, born in 2003, so not after 2004.
- Respondent 29: Male, so does not meet the gender criteria.
- Respondent 147: Female, born in 2003, so not after 2004.
- Respondent 30: Male, so does not meet the gender criteria.

From the given data, only Respondent 118 meets all the specified criteria. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{118}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2004 have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 and a 'Loneliness' score of less than 3?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section and apply the filters as specified:

1. **Male respondents**: We are looking for respondents with `Gender: 1.0`, as per the schema, `1.0` corresponds to `Male`.
2. **Born after 2004**: This means we are looking for respondents with a `Year of birth` greater than 2004.
3. **'Life satisfaction' score of 8**: The respondent must have a `Life satisfaction` score of exactly 8.
4. **'Loneliness' score of less than 3**: The respondent must have a `Loneliness` score of less than 3.

Let's go through the respondents and apply these filters:

- Respondent 64: Female, born in 2005, life satisfaction is 7, and loneliness is 3. Does not match.
- Respondent 38: Male, born in 2004, life satisfaction is 10, and loneliness is 0. Does not match because born in 2004, not after.
- Respondent 83: Male, born in 2004, life satisfaction is 6, and loneliness is 10. Does not match.
- Respondent 101: Female, born in 2003, life satisfaction is 5, and loneliness is 2. Does not match.
- Respondent 126: Male, born in 2005, life satisfaction is 8, and loneliness is 0. Matches all criteria.
- Respondent 37: Female, born in 2004, life satisfaction is 8, and loneliness is 3. Does not match because female and loneliness is exactly 3, not less than 3.
- Respondent 148: Male, born in 2002, life satisfaction is 7, and loneliness is 1. Does not match because born before 2004.
- Respondent 69: Male, born in 2003, life satisfaction is 4, and loneliness is 10. Does not match.
- Respondent 107: Male, born in 2001, life satisfaction is 6, and loneliness is 8. Does not match because born before 2004.

Only Respondent 126 matches all the specified criteria. Therefore, the answer is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2003 have a 'Laughter' score of 7 and a 'Worry' score of less than 4?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify male respondents born after 2003 with a 'Laughter' score of 7 and a 'Worry' score of less than 4.


From the provided data:


- Respondent 127: Born in 2004, Gender: Female, Laughter: 8, Worry: 1
- Respondent 69: Born in 2003, Gender: Male, Laughter: 3, Worry: 1
- Respondent 83: Born in 2004, Gender: Male, Laughter: 1, Worry: 1
- Respondent 73: Born in 2003, Gender: Male, Laughter: 9, Worry: 1
- Respondent 87: Born in 2003, Gender: Male, Laughter: 6, Worry: 2
- Respondent 141: Born in 2004, Gender: Female, Laughter: 1, Worry: 3
- Respondent 148: Born in 2002, Gender: Male, Laughter: 7, Worry: 1
- Respondent 34: Born in 2003, Gender: Male, Laughter: 9, Worry: 0
- Respondent 145: Born in 2022, Gender: Female, Laughter: 4, Worry: 2


The only male respondent born after 2003 with a 'Laughter' score of 7 is not present in the data as all respondents either do not match the birth year, gender, laughter score, or worry score criteria.


However, since the task specifically asks for respondents born ""after 2003"" and given the provided data, none of the male respondents born after 2003 have a 'Laughter' score of 7 and a 'Worry' score of less than 4 that match all criteria.


Thus, based on the given data and the specific criteria, there are no male respondents that fit all the conditions provided in the task.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find those who have more years of education.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 20: Father's education = 22 years, Mother's education = 28 years, Socio-economic status = 6
2. Respondent 34: No parental education data provided.
3. Respondent 58: No parental education data provided.
4. Respondent 133: No parental education data provided.
5. Respondent 114: Father's education = 11 years, Mother's education = 11 years, Socio-economic status = 1
6. Respondent 3: Father's education = 15 years, Mother's education = 5 years, Socio-economic status = 2
7. Respondent 88: Father's education = 25 years, Mother's education = 25 years, Socio-economic status = 4
8. Respondent 31: Father's education = 4 years, Mother's education = 15 years, Socio-economic status = 2
9. Respondent 109: Father's education = 19 years, Mother's education = 23 years, Socio-economic status = 5
10. Respondent 123: Father's education = 18 years, Mother's education = 18 years, Socio-economic status = 5
11. Respondent 19: Father's education = 17 years, Mother's education = 19 years, Socio-economic status = 2

**Step 1: Calculate average years of education for fathers by socio-economic status**

- Socio-economic status 1: (11) / 1 = 11
- Socio-economic status 2: (15 + 4 + 17) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12
- Socio-economic status 4: (25) / 1 = 25
- Socio-economic status 5: (19 + 18) / 2 = 37 / 2 = 18.5
- Socio-economic status 6: (22) / 1 = 22

**Step 2: Compare each mother's education to the average for fathers in the same socio-economic status group**

- Respondent 20: Mother's education (28) vs. average for socio-economic status 6 (22), 28 > 22
- Respondent 114: Mother's education (11) vs. average for socio-economic status 1 (11), 11 = 11
- Respondent 3: Mother's education (5) vs. average for socio-economic status 2 (12), 5 < 12
- Respondent 88: Mother's education (25) vs. average for socio-economic status 4 (25), 25 = 25
- Respondent 31: Mother's education (15) vs. average for socio-economic status 2 (12), 15 > 12
- Respondent 109: Mother's education (23) vs. average for socio-economic status 5 (18.5), 23 > 18.5
- Respondent 123: Mother's education (18) vs. average for socio-economic status 5 (18.5), 18 < 18.5
- Respondent 19: Mother's education (19) vs. average for socio-economic status 2 (12), 19 > 12

**Respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the criteria.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by their socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for the fathers within each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the data:
- Socio-economic status 3.0: Respondents 99, 81, 77, 36, 35, and 98. Their fathers' years of education are 11.0, 11.0, Not provided, Not provided, 13.0, and Not provided, respectively.
- Socio-economic status 5.0: Respondents 23 and 95. Their fathers' years of education are 22.0 and Not provided, respectively.
- Socio-economic status 2.0: Respondent 27. The father's years of education are 17.0.


## Step 3: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group where data is available.
- For socio-economic status 3.0, the average is (11.0 + 11.0 + 13.0) / 3 = 35.0 / 3 = 11.67 (ignoring respondents with missing data).
- For socio-economic status 5.0, only one respondent has data, so the average is 22.0.
- For socio-economic status 2.0, the average is 17.0.


## Step 4: Compare each mother's years of education to the average for her socio-economic status group.
- Respondent 99: Mother's education is 11.0, and the average for socio-economic status 3.0 is 11.67. 11.0 < 11.67.
- Respondent 23: Mother's education is 25.0, and the average for socio-economic status 5.0 is 22.0. 25.0 > 22.0.
- Respondent 27: Mother's education is 11.0, and the average for socio-economic status 2.0 is 17.0. 11.0 < 17.0.
- Respondent 81: Mother's education is 20.0, and the average for socio-economic status 3.0 is 11.67. 20.0 > 11.67.
- Respondent 95: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent 77: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent 36: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent 98: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent 35: Mother's education is 13.0, and the average for socio-economic status 3.0 is 11.67. 13.0 > 11.67.


## Step 5: List the respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
Based on the comparison:
- Respondent 23
- Respondent 81
- Respondent 35


The final answer is: $\boxed{23, 81, 35}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the condition.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for fathers within each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the data:
- Socio-economic status 1: Respondent 136, Father's education = 13 years.
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondents 3 and 90, Fathers' education = 15 and 11 years, respectively. Average = (15 + 11) / 2 = 13 years.
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondents 18, 145, and 113, Fathers' education = Not available for 18 and 145, 11 years for 113. We cannot calculate an average without more data.
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondents 43 and 39, Fathers' education = 17 and Not available for 39, respectively. We cannot calculate an average without more data.
- Socio-economic status 6: Respondent 55, No father's education data available.


## Step 3: Determine the average years of education for mothers in the context of their socio-economic status groups.
Since we are comparing mothers' education to the average of fathers' education within the same socio-economic status, we need the mothers' education data:
- Respondent 18, Mother's education = 16 years, Socio-economic status 3.
- Respondent 136, Mother's education = 5 years, Socio-economic status 1.
- Respondent 3, Mother's education = 5 years, Socio-economic status 2.
- Respondent 145, Mother's education = 15 years, Socio-economic status 3.
- Respondent 43, No mother's education data available.
- Respondent 113, No mother's education data available.
- Respondent 90, No mother's education data available.
- Respondent 55, No mother's education data available.
- Respondent 39, No mother's education data available.


## Step 4: Compare each mother's education to the average father's education in the same socio-economic status group.
For socio-economic status 1, the only father's education is 13 years, and the mother's education is 5 years, which is less.
For socio-economic status 2, the average father's education is 13 years, and the mother's education is 5 years, which is less.
For socio-economic status 3, we cannot accurately compare due to missing data on fathers' education.
Given the data limitations, we can only make a direct comparison for socio-economic status 1 and 2, and neither of these meets the criteria based on available data.


The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$",False

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' exceeds this average for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average Life Satisfaction by Gender:**

   - **Male (Gender: 1.0):**
     - Respondent 114: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 23: Life satisfaction = 6.0
     - Respondent 32: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5.0
     - Respondent 90: Life satisfaction = 5.0
     - Respondent 110: Life satisfaction = 8.0
     - Total Life Satisfaction for Males = 7.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 = 38.0
     - Number of Male Respondents = 6
     - Average Life Satisfaction for Males = 38.0 / 6 = 6.33

   - **Female (Gender: 2.0):**
     - Respondent 56: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 26: Life satisfaction = 4.0
     - Respondent 81: Life satisfaction = 4.0
     - Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Total Life Satisfaction for Females = 7.0 + 7.0 + 4.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 = 29.0
     - Number of Female Respondents = 5
     - Average Life Satisfaction for Females = 29.0 / 5 = 5.8

2. **Identify Respondents with Life Satisfaction Greater than the Average for Their Gender:**

   - **Males with Life Satisfaction > 6.33:**
     - Respondent 114: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 6.33)
     - Respondent 23: Life satisfaction = 6.0 (Not greater than 6.33)
     - Respondent 32: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 6.33)
     - Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5.0 (Not greater than 6.33)
     - Respondent 90: Life satisfaction = 5.0 (Not greater than 6.33)
     - Respondent 110: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (Greater than 6.33)
     - Eligible Male Respondents: 114, 32, 110

   - **Females with Life Satisfaction > 5.8:**
     - Respondent 56: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 5.8)
     - Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 5.8)
     - Respondent 26: Life satisfaction = 4.0 (Not greater than 5.8)
     - Respondent 81: Life satisfaction = 4.0 (Not greater than 5.8)
     - Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 5.8)
     - Eligible Female Respondents: 56, 36, 64

**List of Respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Gender:**

   - **Male (Gender: 1.0):**
     - Respondent 22: Life satisfaction = 6.0
     - Respondent 73: Life satisfaction = 8.0
     - Respondent 7: Life satisfaction = 8.0
     - Average for Male = (6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 22.0 / 3 = 7.33
   - **Female (Gender: 2.0):**
     - Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0
     - Respondent 78: Life satisfaction = 9.0
     - Respondent 53: Life satisfaction = 5.0
     - Respondent 133: Life satisfaction = 6.0
     - Respondent 131: Life satisfaction = 4.0
     - Respondent 49: Life satisfaction = 2.0
     - Average for Female = (7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 + 4.0 + 2.0) / 7 = 40.0 / 7 = 5.71

2. **Identify Respondents with 'Life satisfaction' Greater than the Average for Their Gender:**

   - **Males with Life satisfaction > 7.33:**
     - Respondent 73: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (Greater than 7.33)
     - Respondent 7: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (Greater than 7.33)
   - **Females with Life satisfaction > 5.71:**
     - Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 5.71)
     - Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (Greater than 5.71)
     - Respondent 78: Life satisfaction = 9.0 (Greater than 5.71)
     - Respondent 133: Life satisfaction = 6.0 (Greater than 5.71)

**Respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender are:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Laughter' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is a MCQ with 1. Male and 2. Female, and 'Laughter' is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the average 'Laughter' for each gender:

1. Male:
   - Respondent 76: Laughter = 5
   - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6
   - Respondent 29: Laughter = 4
   - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9
   - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6
   Total Laughter for Males = 5 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 6 = 38
   Number of Males = 6
   Average Laughter for Males = 38 / 6 = 6.33

2. Female:
   - Respondent 14: Laughter = 3
   - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 19: Laughter = 0
   - Respondent 136: Laughter = 3
   Total Laughter for Females = 3 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 3 = 22
   Number of Females = 5
   Average Laughter for Females = 22 / 5 = 4.4

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average for their gender:

1. Males with Laughter > 6.33:
   - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9
   - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6 (not greater than 6.33)
   - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6 (not greater than 6.33)
   - Respondent 29: Laughter = 4 (not greater than 6.33)
   - Respondent 76: Laughter = 5 (not greater than 6.33)

2. Females with Laughter > 4.4:
   - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8
   - Respondent 14: Laughter = 3 (not greater than 4.4)
   - Respondent 19: Laughter = 0 (not greater than 4.4)
   - Respondent 136: Laughter = 3 (not greater than 4.4)

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender are:
76, 99, 29, 128, 4, 93, 14, 62, 127, 19, 136

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find those who have more years of education.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 100: Father's education = 17 years, Socio-economic status = 5
2. Respondent 94: Father's education = 16 years, Socio-economic status = 3
3. Respondent 140: Father's education = 12 years, Socio-economic status = 2
4. Respondent 45: Father's education = 16 years, Socio-economic status = 5
5. Respondent 121: Father's education = 25 years, Socio-economic status = 4
6. Respondent 19: Father's education = 17 years, Socio-economic status = 2
7. Respondent 5: Father's education = 13 years, Socio-economic status = 6

And the mothers' education:
1. Respondent 100: Mother's education = 17 years
2. Respondent 94: Mother's education = 16 years
3. Respondent 140: Mother's education = 12 years
4. Respondent 45: Mother's education = 16 years
5. Respondent 121: Mother's education = 20 years
6. Respondent 19: Mother's education = 19 years
7. Respondent 5: Mother's education = 6 years

Calculating the average years of education for fathers by socio-economic status:
- Socio-economic status 5: (17 + 16) / 2 = 16.5
- Socio-economic status 3: 16 (only one data point)
- Socio-economic status 2: (12 + 17) / 2 = 14.5
- Socio-economic status 4: 25 (only one data point)
- Socio-economic status 6: 13 (only one data point)

Comparing each mother's education to the average for her socio-economic status group:
- Respondent 100 (Socio-economic status 5): Mother's education = 17, Average father's education = 16.5, More educated.
- Respondent 94 (Socio-economic status 3): Mother's education = 16, Average father's education = 16, Not more educated.
- Respondent 140 (Socio-economic status 2): Mother's education = 12, Average father's education = 14.5, Not more educated.
- Respondent 45 (Socio-economic status 5): Mother's education = 16, Average father's education = 16.5, Not more educated.
- Respondent 121 (Socio-economic status 4): Mother's education = 20, Average father's education = 25, Not more educated.
- Respondent 19 (Socio-economic status 2): Mother's education = 19, Average father's education = 14.5, More educated.
- Respondent 5 (Socio-economic status 6): Mother's education = 6, Average father's education = 13, Not more educated.

Therefore, the respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent and then find the average score for respondents born in the same year. After that, we can identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

The 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' section contains the following questions:
1. Anhedonia
2. Depressed Mood
3. Sleep Problems
4. Fatigue
5. Appetite Changes
6. Feelings of Worthlessness
7. Concentration Difficulties
8. Psychomotor Changes
9. Suicidal Thoughts

    - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
    Total: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 5
    Year of birth: 2003

Now, let's calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each year of birth:

- 1998: Respondent 11 (Total: 11), Average: 11
- 2001: Respondents 18 (Total: 12), 4 (Total: 0), 107 (Total: 7), Average: (12 + 0 + 7) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- 2002: Respondents 102 (Total: 2), 130 (Total: 0), 74 (Total: 17), Average: (2 + 0 + 17) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- 2003: Respondents 56 (Total: 3), 16 (Total: 7), 109 (Total: 5), Average: (3 + 7 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
- 2004: Respondents 68 (Total: 15), 129 (Total: 3), Average: (15 + 3) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, let's identify the respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for their birth year:

- 1998: None (Respondent 11 has a score of 11, which is the average)
- 2001: Respondent 4 (Total: 0, Average: 6.33), Respondent 107 (Total: 7, Average: 6.33)
- 2002: Respondent 102 (Total: 2, Average: 6.33), Respondent 130 (Total: 0, Average: 6.33)
- 2003: Respondent 56 (Total: 3, Average: 5), Respondent 109 (Total: 5, Average: 5)
- 2004: Respondent 129 (Total: 3, Average: 9)

The final answer is: $\boxed{4, 102, 130, 56, 109, 129}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a 'Enjoyment' score that is lower than the average 'Enjoyment' score for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Enjoyment' score to the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female, and 'Enjoyment' is scored on a scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender based on the provided responses:

1. **Male (Gender: 1.0)**
   - Respondent 22: Enjoyment = 5.0
   - Respondent 138: Enjoyment = 6.0
   - Respondent 40: Enjoyment = 8.0
   - Respondent 72: Enjoyment = 6.0
   - Respondent 80: Enjoyment = 7.0
   - Respondent 84: Enjoyment = 10.0
   - Total Enjoyment for Males = 5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 = 42.0
   - Number of Male Respondents = 6
   - Average Enjoyment for Males = 42.0 / 6 = 7.0

2. **Female (Gender: 2.0)**
   - Respondent 21: Enjoyment = 5.0
   - Respondent 131: Enjoyment = 6.0
   - Respondent 53: Enjoyment = 5.0
   - Respondent 101: Enjoyment = 5.0
   - Respondent 17: Enjoyment = 9.0
   - Total Enjoyment for Females = 5.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 9.0 = 30.0
   - Number of Female Respondents = 5
   - Average Enjoyment for Females = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Enjoyment' score is lower than the average for their gender:

- For Males (Average = 7.0): Respondents 22 (Enjoyment = 5.0), 138 (Enjoyment = 6.0), 72 (Enjoyment = 6.0), and 80 (Enjoyment = 7.0) have scores lower than or equal to the average. However, since 80 has a score exactly equal to the average, we only consider those below the average: Respondents 22 and 138 and 72.
- For Females (Average = 6.0): Respondents 21 (Enjoyment = 5.0), 131 (Enjoyment = 6.0), 53 (Enjoyment = 5.0), and 101 (Enjoyment = 5.0) have scores lower than or equal to the average. However, since 131 has a score exactly equal to the average, we only consider those below the average: Respondents 21, 53, and 101.

Thus, the respondents with an 'Enjoyment' score lower than the average for their gender are: 22, 138, 72, 21, 53, 101.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

The 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' section contains the following questions:
1. Anhedonia
2. Depressed Mood
3. Sleep Problems
4. Fatigue
5. Appetite Changes
6. Feelings of Worthlessness
7. Concentration Difficulties
8. Psychomotor Changes
9. Suicidal Thoughts

However, in the provided data, not all of these questions are consistently answered by each respondent. For the purpose of this calculation, we will only consider the questions that are present in the data for each respondent.

Let's calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 112: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 13
2. Respondent 62: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 20
3. Respondent 15: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
4. Respondent 63: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4
5. Respondent 23: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
6. Respondent 30: 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
7. Respondent 117: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
8. Respondent 80: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4
9. Respondent 45: 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6
10. Respondent 31: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 18

Next, we need to find the average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for respondents born in each year.

- 2001: (13 + 2) / 2 = 7.5
- 2002: (2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 6) / 5 = 3.8
- 2003: (20 + 2) / 2 = 11
- 2004: 4 (only one respondent)

Now, let's identify which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for their birth year:

- 2001: Respondent 23 (score 2) is lower than the average.
- 2002: Respondents 15 (score 2), 30 (score 3), 45 (score 6), 80 (score 4) are lower than the average, but since 45 has a score of 6 which is higher than the average of 3.8, it should not be included. Respondent 117 (score 2) is also lower than the average.
- 2003: Respondent 117 (score 2) is lower than the average.
- 2004: Since there's only one respondent, no comparison can be made.

Therefore, the respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for their birth year are Respondents 23, 15, 30, 80, and 117.",False
