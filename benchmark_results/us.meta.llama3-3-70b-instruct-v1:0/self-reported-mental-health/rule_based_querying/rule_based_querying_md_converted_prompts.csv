<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the respondents who are female and were born before 2002.

From the provided data, we can see that:

- Respondent 30 was born in 2002 and is male.
- Respondent 51 was born in 2002 and is female.
- Respondent 68 was born in 2004 and is male.
- Respondent 81 was born in 2002 and is female.
- Respondent 90 was born in 2002 and is male.
- Respondent 100 was born in 1999 and is male.
- Respondent 101 was born in 2003 and is female.
- Respondent 118 was born in 2005 and is female.
- Respondent 126 was born in 2005 and is male.
- Respondent 136 was born in 2005 and is female.

However, upon re-examining the instructions and the data provided, it seems there was an error in interpreting the gender codes. According to the schema, ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"" are the codes for gender. Thus, the correct identification based on the gender code is:

- Respondent 30 (Gender: 1.0, Year of birth: 2002.0) is male.
- Respondent 51 (Gender: 2.0, Year of birth: 2002.0) is female.
- Respondent 68 (Gender: 1.0, Year of birth: 2004.0) is male.
- Respondent 81 (Gender: 2.0, Year of birth: 2002.0) is female.
- Respondent 90 (Gender: 1.0, Year of birth: 2002.0) is male.
- Respondent 100 (Gender: 1.0, Year of birth: 1999.0) is male.
- Respondent 101 (Gender: 2.0, Year of birth: 2003.0) is female.
- Respondent 118 (Gender: 2.0, Year of birth: 2005.0) is female.
- Respondent 126 (Gender: 1.0, Year of birth: 2005.0) is male.
- Respondent 136 (Gender: 2.0, Year of birth: 2005.0) is female.

Given the task is to list all female respondents born before 2002, and based on the correct interpretation of the gender codes:

The only female respondents born before 2002 are Respondent 100 (born in 1999) and none of the others meet the criteria of being born before 2002 and being female based on the correct gender code interpretation.

Therefore, the correct list of female respondents born before 2002 is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2002 have a 'Happiness' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 3?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify male respondents born after 2002 with a 'Happiness' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 3.

First, let's filter the respondents based on the year of birth. We are looking for respondents born after 2002, which means their year of birth should be 2003 or later.

Next, we need to identify male respondents. According to the schema, the 'Gender' field is a multiple-choice question with options 1. Male and 2. Female. So, we are looking for respondents with a 'Gender' score of 1.

Then, we filter the respondents based on their 'Happiness' score, which should be exactly 6.

Finally, we filter the respondents based on their 'Depression' score, which should be less than 3.

Let's examine the respondents:

- Respondent 14: Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
- Respondent 92: Born in 2003, male, 'Happiness' score is 7, so not a match.
- Respondent 3: Born in 1998, so not after 2002.
- Respondent 125: Born in 2004, male, 'Happiness' score is 8, so not a match.
- Respondent 35: Born in 2001, so not after 2002.
- Respondent 50: Born in 2003, male, 'Happiness' score is 10, so not a match.
- Respondent 99: Born in 2001, so not after 2002, and not male.
- Respondent 144: Born in 2004, male, 'Happiness' score is 7, so not a match.
- Respondent 130: Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
- Respondent 127: Born in 2004, male, 'Happiness' score is 7, so not a match.
- Respondent 105: Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
- Respondent 126: Born in 2005, male, 'Happiness' score is 6, and 'Depression' score is 0, which is less than 3.

Based on the given data, only Respondent 126 meets all the criteria: born after 2002, male, 'Happiness' score of 6, and 'Depression' score of less than 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{126}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12, we need to calculate the total score for each respondent and then identify those who meet the criteria.


## Step 1: Identify the 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' questions
The 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' section contains the following questions:
- **Upset by Unexpected Events:** how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?
- **Unable to Control Important Things:** how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?
- **Nervous and Stressed:** how often have you felt nervous and stressed?
- **Lacked Confidence Handling Problems:** how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?
- **Things Going Your Way:** how often have you felt that things were going your way?
- **Unable to Cope:** how often have you found that you could not cope with all the things that you had to do?
- **Irritated by Life:** how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?
- **On Top of Things:** how often have you felt that you were on top of things?
- **Angered by Uncontrollable Events:** how often have you been angered because of things that happened that were outside of your control?
- **Felt Overwhelmed:** how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?

However, not all respondents have answers to all these questions, and some questions are not present in every respondent's data. We will only consider the questions that are present in each respondent's data.


## Step 2: Calculate the total score for each respondent
We will calculate the total score for each respondent by summing up the scores of the 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' questions that are present in their data.


Respondent 114:
- **Upset by Unexpected Events:** 1.0
- **Unable to Control Important Things:** 2.0

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for the corresponding socio-economic status group of the respondent.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for fathers in each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the data:
- Socio-economic status 1: Respondents 58, 114, and 19 have fathers with 0 (not specified), 11, and 17 years of education, respectively. Average = (0 + 11 + 17) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33 years.
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondents 3 and 31 have fathers with 15 and 4 years of education, respectively. Average = (15 + 4) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5 years.
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent 88 has a father with 25 years of education. Since there's only one, the average is 25 years.
- Socio-economic status 5: Respondent 123 has a father with 18 years of education. Since there's only one, the average is 18 years.
- Socio-economic status 6: Respondents 20 and 34 have fathers with 22 and 0 (not specified) years of education, respectively. Average = (22 + 0) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 years.


## Step 3: Compare each mother's years of education to the average for the corresponding socio-economic status group.
- Respondent 20 (socio-economic status 6): Mother has 28 years of education, which is more than the average of 11 years for fathers in socio-economic status 6.
- Respondent 34 (socio-economic status 6): No mother's education specified.
- Respondent 58 (socio-economic status 1): No mother's education specified.
- Respondent 114 (socio-economic status 1): Mother has 11 years of education, which is more than the average of 9.33 years for fathers in socio-economic status 1.
- Respondent 3 (socio-economic status 2): Mother has 5 years of education, which is less than the average of 9.5 years for fathers in socio-economic status 2.
- Respondent 88 (socio-economic status 4): Mother has 25 years of education, which is equal to the average for fathers in socio-economic status 4, not more.
- Respondent 31 (socio-economic status 2): Mother has 15 years of education, which is more than the average of 9.5 years for fathers in socio-economic status 2.
- Respondent 109 (socio-economic status 5): Mother has 23 years of education, which is more than the average of 18 years for fathers in socio-economic status 5.
- Respondent 123 (socio-economic status 5): Mother has 18 years of education, which is equal to the average for fathers in socio-economic status 5, not more.
- Respondent 19 (socio-economic status 1): Mother has 19 years of education, which is more than the average of 9.33 years for fathers in socio-economic status 1.


## Step 4: List the respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
Based on the comparison:
- Respondent 20
- Respondent 114
- Respondent 31
- Respondent 109
- Respondent 19


The final answer is: $\boxed{20, 114, 31, 109, 19}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for the corresponding socio-economic status group of the respondent.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for fathers in each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the data:
- Socio-economic status 3.0: Respondents 99, 77, 36, 98, and 35. Their fathers' education years are 11.0, None, None, None, and 13.0 respectively. Since we cannot calculate an average with missing values, we will only consider respondents with complete data for this calculation. Thus, the average for socio-economic status 3.0, based on available data, is (11.0 + 13.0) / 2 = 12.0.
- Socio-economic status 5.0: Respondents 23 and 95. Their fathers' education years are 22.0 and None respectively. Again, due to missing data, we can only consider respondent 23 for this calculation, making the average for socio-economic status 5.0, based on available data, 22.0.
- Socio-economic status 2.0: Respondent 27. The father's education year is 17.0. Thus, the average for socio-economic status 2.0 is 17.0.


## Step 3: Compare each mother's years of education to the average for the corresponding socio-economic status group.
- Respondent 99: Socio-economic status 3.0, mother's education 11.0. The average for fathers in this group is 12.0, so the mother has less education.
- Respondent 23: Socio-economic status 5.0, mother's education 25.0. The average for fathers in this group is 22.0, so the mother has more education.
- Respondent 27: Socio-economic status 2.0, mother's education 11.0. The average for fathers in this group is 17.0, so the mother has less education.
- Respondent 81: Socio-economic status 3.0, mother's education 20.0. The average for fathers in this group is 12.0, so the mother has more education.
- Respondent 95: Socio-economic status 5.0, mother's education is missing. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 77: Mother's education is missing. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 36: Mother's education is missing. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 98: Mother's education is missing. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 35: Socio-economic status 3.0, mother's education 13.0. The average for fathers in this group is 12.0, so the mother has more education.


## Step 4: List the respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
Based on the comparison:
- Respondent 23
- Respondent 81
- Respondent 35


The final answer is: $\boxed{23, 81, 35}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for the corresponding socio-economic status group of the respondent.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for fathers within each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the provided data:
- Respondent 18: Socio-economic status 3, Father's education not provided.
- Respondent 136: Socio-economic status 1, Father's education 13 years.
- Respondent 145: Socio-economic status 3, Father's education 25 years.
- Respondent 3: Socio-economic status 2, Father's education 15 years.
- Respondent 43: Socio-economic status 4, Father's education 17 years.
- Respondent 113: Socio-economic status 3, Father's education 11 years.
- Respondent 90: Socio-economic status 2, Father's education 11 years.
- Respondent 55: Socio-economic status 6, Father's education not provided.
- Respondent 39: Socio-economic status 4, Father's education not provided.

Given the limited data, we can only calculate averages for socio-economic status groups where we have at least one father's education level:
- Socio-economic status 1: Average = 13 years (from Respondent 136).
- Socio-economic status 2: Average = (15 + 11) / 2 = 13 years (from Respondents 3 and 90).
- Socio-economic status 3: Average = (25 + 11) / 2 = 18 years (from Respondents 145 and 113).
- Socio-economic status 4: Average = 17 years (from Respondent 43).
- Socio-economic status 6: No father's education data available.


## Step 3: Compare each mother's years of education to the average for the corresponding socio-economic status group.
- Respondent 18: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education 16 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 3 is 18 years. Since 16 < 18, Respondent 18 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 136: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education 5 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 1 is 13 years. Since 5 < 13, Respondent 136 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 145: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education 15 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 3 is 18 years. Since 15 < 18, Respondent 145 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 3: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 5 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 2 is 13 years. Since 5 < 13, Respondent 3 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 43: Socio-economic status 4, Mother's education not provided.
- Respondent 113: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education not provided.
- Respondent 90: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education not provided.
- Respondent 55: Socio-economic status 6, Mother's education not provided.
- Respondent 39: Socio-economic status 4, Mother's education not provided.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' exceeds this average for their respective gender.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Gender

We will calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males (Gender: 1.0) and females (Gender: 2.0) separately.

#### Males (Gender: 1.0)

Respondents 114, 23, 32, 99, 90, and 110 are males.

- Respondent 114: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 23: Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 32: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5.0
- Respondent 90: Life satisfaction = 5.0
- Respondent 110: Life satisfaction = 8.0

Average Life satisfaction for males = (7.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 8.0) / 6 = 38.0 / 6 = 6.33

#### Females (Gender: 2.0)

Respondents 56, 36, 26, 81, and 64 are females.

- Respondent 56: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 26: Life satisfaction = 4.0
- Respondent 81: Life satisfaction = 4.0
- Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0

Average Life satisfaction for females = (7.0 + 7.0 + 4.0 + 4.0 + 7.0) / 5 = 29.0 / 5 = 5.8

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than the Average for Their Gender

#### Males

- Respondent 114: 7.0 (less than 6.33, no)
- Respondent 23: 6.0 (less than 6.33, no)
- Respondent 32: 7.0 (greater than 6.33, yes)
- Respondent 99: 5.0 (less than 6.33, no)
- Respondent 90: 5.0 (less than 6.33, no)
- Respondent 110: 8.0 (greater than 6.33, yes)

#### Females

- Respondent 56: 7.0 (greater than 5.8, yes)
- Respondent 36: 7.0 (greater than 5.8, yes)
- Respondent 26: 4.0 (less than 5.8, no)
- Respondent 81: 4.0 (less than 5.8, no)
- Respondent 64: 7.0 (greater than 5.8, yes)

### Respondents with 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than the Average for Their Gender

Males: Respondent 32, Respondent 110
Females: Respondent 56, Respondent 36, Respondent 64

Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender is: 32, 110, 56, 36, 64.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' exceeds this average for their respective gender.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Gender

We will calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males (Gender: 1.0) and females (Gender: 2.0) separately.

#### Males:
- Respondent 22: Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 73: Life satisfaction = 8.0
- Respondent 7: Life satisfaction = 8.0

Total Life satisfaction for males = 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 = 22.0  
Number of males = 3  
Average Life satisfaction for males = Total / Number = 22.0 / 3 = 7.33

#### Females:
- Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 78: Life satisfaction = 9.0
- Respondent 53: Life satisfaction = 5.0
- Respondent 133: Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 131: Life satisfaction = 4.0
- Respondent 49: Life satisfaction = 2.0

Total Life satisfaction for females = 7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 = 40.0  
Number of females = 7  
Average Life satisfaction for females = Total / Number = 40.0 / 7 = 5.71

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than the Average for Their Gender

#### Males with Life satisfaction > 7.33:
- Respondent 73: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (exceeds average)
- Respondent 7: Life satisfaction = 8.0 (exceeds average)

#### Females with Life satisfaction > 5.71:
- Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (exceeds average)
- Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0 (exceeds average)
- Respondent 78: Life satisfaction = 9.0 (exceeds average)

### Conclusion

The respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender are:
- Male Respondents: 73, 7
- Female Respondents: 64, 142, 78

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs whose 'Life satisfaction' exceeds the average for their gender is 73, 7, 64, 142, 78.",False

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Laughter' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Laughter' exceeds this average for their respective gender.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Laughter' for Each Gender

We need to separate the respondents by gender and calculate the average 'Laughter' for each group.

- **Male (Gender: 1.0)**: 
  - Respondent 76: Laughter = 5.0
  - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6.0
  - Respondent 29: Laughter = 4.0
  - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9.0
  - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8.0
  - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6.0
- **Female (Gender: 2.0)**: 
  - Respondent 14: Laughter = 3.0
  - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8.0
  - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8.0
  - Respondent 19: Laughter = 0.0
  - Respondent 136: Laughter = 3.0

### Step 2: Calculate Average Laughter for Males
Average Laughter for Males = (5.0 + 6.0 + 4.0 + 9.0 + 8.0 + 6.0) / 6 = 38.0 / 6 = 6.33

### Step 3: Calculate Average Laughter for Females
Average Laughter for Females = (3.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 0.0 + 3.0) / 5 = 22.0 / 5 = 4.4

### Step 4: Identify Respondents with Laughter Greater Than the Average for Their Gender

- **Males with Laughter > 6.33**:
  - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9.0
  - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8.0 (does not exceed the average)
  - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6.0 (does not exceed the average)
  - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6.0 (does not exceed the average)
- **Females with Laughter > 4.4**:
  - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8.0
  - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8.0

### Step 5: List the Respondents
Respondents with 'Laughter' greater than the average for their gender are:
- Male: 128
- Female: 62, 127

The final answer is: $\boxed{62, 127, 128}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for the corresponding socio-economic status group of the respondent.


## Step 1: Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
We need to group the respondents by their socio-economic status and calculate the average years of education for the fathers within each group.


## Step 2: Identify the socio-economic status groups and their corresponding average years of education for fathers.
From the provided data:
- Socio-economic status 1: Respondent 108 (Father's education: Not provided), Respondent 140 (Father's education: 12.0)
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondent 146 (Father's education: 9.0), Respondent 19 (Father's education: 17.0), Respondent 5 (Father's education: 13.0)
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondent 94 (Father's education: 16.0)
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent 121 (Father's education: 25.0)
- Socio-economic status 5: Respondent 100 (Father's education: 17.0), Respondent 45 (Father's education: 16.0)
- Socio-economic status 6: Respondent 34 (Father's education: Not provided), Respondent 121 does not belong to this group based on the initial assessment but was incorrectly considered; the correct assessment should focus on Respondent 5 (Father's education: 13.0) for socio-economic status 6.


## Step 3: Correctly calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
- For socio-economic status 1, we cannot calculate an average due to missing data.
- For socio-economic status 2, the average is (9.0 + 17.0 + 13.0) / 3 = 39.0 / 3 = 13.0
- For socio-economic status 3, the average is 16.0 (only one data point)
- For socio-economic status 4, the average is 25.0 (only one data point)
- For socio-economic status 5, the average is (17.0 + 16.0) / 2 = 33.0 / 2 = 16.5
- For socio-economic status 6, considering only Respondent 5 for accuracy in this group, the average would be 13.0, but since we should not have included Respondent 121 in socio-economic status 6 and there's an error in considering Respondent 5's group, we need to reassess correctly:
- Respondent 5 is actually in socio-economic status 6, so the average for socio-economic status 6, with correct data, is just 13.0 for the father's education.


## Step 4: Compare each mother's years of education to the average for the corresponding socio-economic status group.
- Respondent 108: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education not provided, cannot compare.
- Respondent 146: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 9.0, average for fathers 13.0, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 19: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 19.0, average for fathers 13.0, meets the criteria.
- Respondent 5: Socio-economic status 6, Mother's education 6.0, average for fathers in socio-economic status 6 is 13.0, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 100: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education 17.0, average for fathers 16.5, meets the criteria.
- Respondent 94: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education 16.0, average for fathers 16.0, does not meet the criteria because it's not more than the average.
- Respondent 140: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 12.0, average for fathers 13.0, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 45: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education 16.0, average for fathers 16.5, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 121: Socio-economic status 4, Mother's education 20.0, average for fathers 25.0, does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 34: Socio-economic status 6, Mother's education not provided, cannot compare.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent:**

For each respondent, we sum up the scores of 'Anhedonia', 'Depressed Mood', 'Sleep Problems', 'Fatigue', 'Appetite Changes', 'Feelings of Worthlessness', 'Concentration Difficulties', 'Psychomotor Changes', and 'Suicidal Thoughts' under 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency'.

2. **Find the Average Score for Respondents Born in Each Year:**

Group respondents by their year of birth, calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each group, and then find the average by dividing the total score by the number of respondents in each group.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year:**

Compare each respondent's total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score with the average score of their respective birth year group. Identify those with a lower score.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's proceed with calculating the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' for each respondent and then determine the averages for each birth year.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a 'Enjoyment' score that is lower than the average 'Enjoyment' score for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Enjoyment' score to the average of their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average 'Enjoyment' Score by Gender:**

   - **Male (Gender: 1.0):**
     - Respondent 22: Enjoyment = 5.0
     - Respondent 138: Enjoyment = 6.0
     - Respondent 40: Enjoyment = 8.0
     - Respondent 72: Enjoyment = 6.0
     - Respondent 80: Enjoyment = 7.0
     - Respondent 84: Enjoyment = 10.0
     - Total Enjoyment for Males = 5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 = 42.0
     - Number of Male Respondents = 6
     - Average Enjoyment for Males = Total Enjoyment for Males / Number of Male Respondents = 42.0 / 6 = 7.0

   - **Female (Gender: 2.0):**
     - Respondent 21: Enjoyment = 5.0
     - Respondent 131: Enjoyment = 6.0
     - Respondent 53: Enjoyment = 5.0
     - Respondent 101: Enjoyment = 5.0
     - Respondent 17: Enjoyment = 9.0
     - Total Enjoyment for Females = 5.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 9.0 = 30.0
     - Number of Female Respondents = 5
     - Average Enjoyment for Females = Total Enjoyment for Females / Number of Female Respondents = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

2. **Identify Respondents with 'Enjoyment' Score Lower than the Average for Their Gender:**

   - **Males with Enjoyment < 7.0:**
     - Respondent 22: Enjoyment = 5.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 138: Enjoyment = 6.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 72: Enjoyment = 6.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 80: Enjoyment = 7.0 (Equal to average, not lower)

   - **Females with Enjoyment < 6.0:**
     - Respondent 21: Enjoyment = 5.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 53: Enjoyment = 5.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 101: Enjoyment = 5.0 (Lower than average)

3. **List of Respondents with 'Enjoyment' Score Lower than the Average for Their Gender:**

   - Males: 22, 138, 72
   - Females: 21, 53, 101

**Final Answer:** 22, 138, 72, 21, 53, 101",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent and then find the average score for respondents born in the same year. After that, we can identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's break down the steps to follow:

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up all the scores under 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency'.

2. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score by Year of Birth:**
   - Group respondents by their year of birth.
   - For each year, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year:**
   - Compare each respondent's total score with the average score for their birth year.
   - List the IDs of respondents whose score is lower than the average.

Let's perform these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 112: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11
- Respondent 62: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent 15: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
- Respondent 63: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
- Respondent 23: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
- Respondent 30: 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
- Respondent 117: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
- Respondent 80: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4
- Respondent 45: 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6
- Respondent 31: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 15

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score by Year of Birth

- **2001:** (11 + 2) / 2 = 13 / 2 = 6.5
- **2002:** (2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) / 6 = 20 / 6 ≈ 3.33
- **2003:** (17 + 2) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5
- **2004:** 3 (Only one respondent)

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year

- **2001:** Respondent 23 (Score: 2) is lower than the average (6.5)
- **2002:** Respondents 15 (Score: 2), 63 (Score: 3), 23 (Score: 2), and 117 (Score: 2) are lower than the average (3.33). However, since 23 is actually born in 2001, we should not include it here. The correct list for 2002 includes 15, 30 (Score: 3), 117, and actually, all scores except 45 (Score: 6) are lower than or very close to the average, indicating a miscalculation in the average comparison due to the nature of the question. Correctly, for 2002, all respondents except 45 have scores lower or very close to the calculated average, suggesting a need to reassess the comparison method.
- **2003:** Respondent 117 (Score: 2) is lower than the average (9.5)
- **2004:** Since there's only one respondent, no comparison can be made.

Given the recalculated averages and comparisons, the task's request for respondents with a total score lower than the average for their birth year, considering the miscalculation in comparison for the year 2002, the corrected approach should focus on the actual calculation and comparison without the error:

- For **2001**, Respondent 23.
- For **2002**, given the misunderstanding in comparison, we should note all respondents have lower scores than the incorrectly implied average, but specifically, 15, 30, 80, and 117 have scores that are indeed lower than the average when considering the scores correctly.
- For **2003**, Respondent 117.

However, the correct interpretation of the task requires identifying respondents with scores lower than the average for their respective birth years without the miscalculation:

The final answer is: $\boxed{23, 15, 30, 117, 80}$",False
