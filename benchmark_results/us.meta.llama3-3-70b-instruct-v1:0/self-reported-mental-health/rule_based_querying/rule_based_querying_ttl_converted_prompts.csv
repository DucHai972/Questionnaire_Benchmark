</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2003.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the female respondents and their year of birth from the provided data.


From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The question about gender is represented as "":QGender pred:Text 'What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]'"".
- The question about the year of birth is represented as "":QYear_of_birth pred:Text 'What is your date of birth? [Open-ended]'"".


Given this, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who are female (gender = 2.0, which corresponds to 'Female') and born before 2003.


The relevant respondents are:
- :Respondent27 with pred:Year_of_birth 2003.0 and pred:Gender 2.0. However, since the year of birth is exactly 2003, this respondent does not meet the criteria of being born before 2003.
- :Respondent37 with pred:Year_of_birth 2004.0 and pred:Gender 2.0. This respondent is born after 2003.
- :Respondent53 with pred:Year_of_birth 2004.0 and pred:Gender 2.0. This respondent is also born after 2003.
- :Respondent134 with pred:Year_of_birth 2003.0 and pred:Gender 2.0. Similar to Respondent27, this respondent is born in 2003, not before.


However, upon re-examining the data for accuracy in following the instructions:
- We find that there are no female respondents explicitly listed as being born before 2003 in the provided data snippet.


Thus, based on the provided data and the specific criteria given (female and born before 2003), there are no respondents that meet this condition. The initial analysis missed considering the exact requirement for the year of birth to be before 2003, which upon careful review, reveals that the mentioned respondents do not fulfill this criterion due to either being born in 2003 or after. 

Given the strict format requirement and the need to adhere to the instructions precisely, the correct interpretation of the task leads to the conclusion that there are no female respondents born before 2003 as per the given data.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the female respondents and their year of birth from the provided data.


From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The year of birth is represented by the predicate ""pred:Year_of_birth"".
- The gender is represented by the predicate ""pred:Gender"", with ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"" as the options.


Looking at the 'responses' section, we can find the following respondents born before 2002 who are female (Gender = 2.0):


None of the respondents match the criteria of being female and born before 2002.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' score is exactly 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' score is exactly 3, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and look for the 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' scores.


After reviewing the data, the respondents with a combined 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' score of exactly 3 are:


Respondent43: Stress = 4, Loneliness = 7 (combined score is 11, not 3)


Respondent126: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 0 (combined score is 2, not 3)


Respondent138: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 5 (combined score is 7, not 3)


Respondent45: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 0 (combined score is 2, not 3)


Respondent48: Stress = 3, Loneliness = 3 (combined score is 6, not 3)


Respondent74: Stress = 4, Loneliness = 10 (combined score is 14, not 3)


Respondent81: Stress = 4, Loneliness = 10 (combined score is 14, not 3)


Respondent109: Stress = 4, Loneliness = 10 (combined score is 14, not 3)


Respondent125: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 3 (combined score is 5, not 3)


Respondent143: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 7 (combined score is 9, not 3)


Respondent36: Stress = 2, Loneliness = 3 (combined score is 5, not 3)


No respondent has a combined 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' score of exactly 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data. 

The 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' section has the following questions:
- Upset_by_Unexpected_Events
- Unable_to_Control_Important_Things
- Lacked_Confidence_Handling_Problems
- Unable_to_Cope
- Irritated_by_Life
- On_Top_of_Things

We will calculate the total score for each respondent by summing up the scores of these questions.

Here are the calculations:

- Respondent114: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12
- Respondent126: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 12
- Respondent43: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13
- Respondent22: 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 13
- Respondent145: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
- Respondent8: 3 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent57: 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16
- Respondent75: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 15
- Respondent9: 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 15
- Respondent71: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 15
- Respondent58: 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14

The respondents with a total score greater than 12 are:
- Respondent43
- Respondent22
- Respondent8
- Respondent57
- Respondent75
- Respondent9
- Respondent71
- Respondent58

The final answer is: Respondent43, Respondent22, Respondent8, Respondent57, Respondent75, Respondent9, Respondent71, Respondent58",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and calculate the total score for each respondent based on the 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' questions.

The 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' questions are:
- Upset_by_Unexpected_Events
- Unable_to_Control_Important_Things
- Lacked_Confidence_Handling_Problems
- Unable_to_Cope
- Irritated_by_Life
- On_Top_of_Things

We will calculate the total score for each respondent by summing up their scores for these questions.

Here are the calculations:

- Respondent75: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 15
- Respondent147: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12
- Respondent69: 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10
- Respondent132: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 16
- Respondent25: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12
- Respondent35: 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12
- Respondent106: 3 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16
- Respondent16: 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13
- Respondent71: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 15
- Respondent33: 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 13

The respondents with a total score greater than 12 are:
Respondent75, Respondent132, Respondent106, Respondent16, Respondent71, Respondent33

So, the list of respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12 is: 
75, 132, 106, 16, 71, 33",False

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 15.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 15, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data.


The 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' section has the following predicates: 
- pred:Upset_by_Unexpected_Events
- pred:Unable_to_Control_Important_Things
- pred:Lacked_Confidence_Handling_Problems
- pred:Unable_to_Cope
- pred:Irritated_by_Life
- pred:On_Top_of_Things


We will calculate the total score for each respondent by summing up the values of these predicates.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's mother's years of education to this average for their respective socio-economic status group.

1. **Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:**

From the data, we can extract the following information regarding fathers' education and socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 1: Respondent58 (not directly provided), Respondent114 (Father: 11 years), Respondent133 (not directly provided as father but mentioned for Respondent133_Parental_Education as Father: 18 years is incorrect since Respondent133 is actually a respondent and not a parental education entry for another respondent, the correct one for socio-economic status 1 is Respondent114 and another is Respondent88 is not in this group but Respondent3 is in socio-economic status 2, so we only have Respondent114 and actually Respondent58 does not have parental education listed but Respondent88 does and is in socio-economic status 4, so we look at Respondent114 and any others in socio-economic status 1 which includes Respondent133 does not have a father listed but Respondent19 does not but Respondent3 does and is in a different group, so we actually have Respondent114 and need to look for others in the same socio-economic status which includes Respondent58 but the father's education is not listed for Respondent58 but is for Respondent114 and another in the same group is not found but we see Respondent88 is in a different group, so we only have Respondent114's father's education for socio-economic status 1 which is 11 years, and we also see Respondent58 does not have it listed but we do see Respondent19 has a father's education of 17 years and is in socio-economic status 2, so not included, but we see Respondent114 has 11 and another in the same socio-economic status 1 is Respondent58 but the years are not listed, however we see Respondent133 is in socio-economic status 1 and has a father's education of 18 years).

- Socio-economic status 2: Respondent3 (Father: 15 years), Respondent31 (Father: 4 years), Respondent19 (Father: 17 years).

- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent88 (Father: 25 years).

- Socio-economic status 5: Respondent109 (Father: 19 years), Respondent123 (Father: 18 years).

- Socio-economic status 6: Respondent20 (Father: 22 years), Respondent34 (no father's education listed directly but implied to be part of the data, however, we do not use implied data, so we only have Respondent20 for socio-economic status 6 which is 22 years).

Now, calculating the averages:

- Socio-economic status 1: (11 + 18) / 2 = 29 / 2 = 14.5 years.
- Socio-economic status 2: (15 + 4 + 17) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12 years.
- Socio-economic status 4: 25 years (only one data point).
- Socio-economic status 5: (19 + 18) / 2 = 37 / 2 = 18.5 years.
- Socio-economic status 6: 22 years (only one data point).

2. **Compare each respondent's mother's years of education to the average for their socio-economic status group:**

- Respondent20: Socio-economic status 6, Mother's education 28 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 6 is 22 years. Since 28 > 22, Respondent20 qualifies.
- Respondent34: Socio-economic status 6, but no mother's education listed directly.
- Respondent58: Socio-economic status 1, but no mother's education listed directly.
- Respondent114: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education 11 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 1 is 14.5 years. Since 11 < 14.5, Respondent114 does not qualify.
- Respondent3: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 5 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 2 is 12 years. Since 5 < 12, Respondent3 does not qualify.
- Respondent88: Socio-economic status 4, Mother's education 25 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 4 is 25 years. Since 25 = 25, Respondent88 does not qualify because it's not more than the average.
- Respondent31: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 15 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 2 is 12 years. Since 15 > 12, Respondent31 qualifies.
- Respondent109: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education 23 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 5 is 18.5 years. Since 23 > 18.5, Respondent109 qualifies.
- Respondent123: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education 18 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 5 is 18.5 years. Since 18 < 18.5, Respondent123 does not qualify.
- Respondent19: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education 19 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 2 is 12 years. Since 19 > 12, Respondent19 qualifies.
- Respondent133: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education 18 years. Average for fathers in socio-economic status 1 is 14.5 years. Since 18 > 14.5, Respondent133 qualifies.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's mother's years of education to this average for their respective socio-economic status group.

1. **Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:**

From the data provided, we can extract the following information regarding the years of education for fathers and the socio-economic status of the respondents:

- Respondent99: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = 11
- Respondent23: Socio-economic status = 5, Father's education = 22
- Respondent27: Socio-economic status = 2, Father's education = 17
- Respondent81: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = 11
- Respondent95: Socio-economic status = 5, Father's education = (Not provided)
- Respondent77: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = (Not provided)
- Respondent36: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = (Not provided)
- Respondent98: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = (Not provided)
- Respondent35: Socio-economic status = 3, Father's education = 13

Given the incomplete data for some respondents, we can only calculate the average for socio-economic status groups where we have at least two data points:

- Socio-economic status = 3: (11 + 11 + 13) / 3 = 35 / 3 = 11.67
- Socio-economic status = 5: 22 / 1 = 22 (Only one data point, so it's not an average but a single value)
- Socio-economic status = 2: 17 / 1 = 17 (Only one data point)

2. **Compare each respondent's mother's years of education to the average for their socio-economic status group:**

- Respondent99: Mother's education = 11, Socio-economic status = 3. Since 11 < 11.67, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent23: Mother's education = 25, Socio-economic status = 5. Since 25 > 22, this respondent meets the criteria.
- Respondent27: Mother's education = 11, Socio-economic status = 2. Since 11 < 17, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent81: Mother's education = 20, Socio-economic status = 3. Since 20 > 11.67, this respondent meets the criteria.
- Respondent95: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent77: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent36: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent98: No mother's education data provided.
- Respondent35: Mother's education = 13, Socio-economic status = 3. Since 13 > 11.67, this respondent meets the criteria.

**Respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's mother's years of education to this average for their respective socio-economic status group.

1. **Calculate the average years of education for fathers by socio-economic status:**

From the data provided, we can extract the following information regarding fathers' education by socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 1: Respondent136 (Father = 13 years)
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondent3 (Father = 15 years), Respondent90 (Father = 11 years)
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondent18 (no father's education listed), Respondent145 (Father = 25 years)
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent43 (Father = 17 years), Respondent39 (Father = 17 years)
- Socio-economic status 6: Respondent55 (no father's education listed), Respondent113 (Father = 11 years)

**Calculating averages:**

- Socio-economic status 1: (13) / 1 = 13
- Socio-economic status 2: (15 + 11) / 2 = 13
- Socio-economic status 3: (25) / 1 = 25 (since only one value is available)
- Socio-economic status 4: (17 + 17) / 2 = 17
- Socio-economic status 6: (11) / 1 = 11

2. **Identify respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group:**

- Respondent18: Mother = 16 years, Socio-economic status = 3, Average for fathers in status 3 = 25. Since 16 < 25, Respondent18 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent136: Mother = 5 years, Socio-economic status = 1, Average for fathers in status 1 = 13. Since 5 < 13, Respondent136 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent145: Mother = 15 years, Socio-economic status = 3, Average for fathers in status 3 = 25. Since 15 < 25, Respondent145 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent3: Mother = 5 years, Socio-economic status = 2, Average for fathers in status 2 = 13. Since 5 < 13, Respondent3 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent43: No mother's education listed.
- Respondent113: No mother's education listed.
- Respondent90: No mother's education listed.
- Respondent55: No comparison can be made directly due to missing data on father's education for socio-economic status 6, but since the mother's education is not provided, we cannot include Respondent55.
- Respondent39: No mother's education listed for comparison, but the socio-economic status is 4 with an average of 17 for fathers. Without the mother's education, we cannot assess.

Given the provided data and calculations, **none** of the respondents with listed mothers' education years have more years of education than the calculated average for fathers in their respective socio-economic status groups, based on the available data. However, due to missing data for some respondents, this analysis might not be comprehensive. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{[]}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

From the provided data, we can calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females separately.

Males:
- Respondent114: 7.0
- Respondent23: 6.0
- Respondent32: 7.0
- Respondent99: 5.0
- Respondent90: 5.0
- Respondent110: 8.0

Total Life satisfaction for males = 7.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 = 38.0
Number of males = 6
Average Life satisfaction for males = 38.0 / 6 = 6.33

Females:
- Respondent56: 7.0
- Respondent36: 7.0
- Respondent81: 4.0
- Respondent64: 7.0
- Respondent26: 4.0

Total Life satisfaction for females = 7.0 + 7.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 + 4.0 = 29.0
Number of females = 5
Average Life satisfaction for females = 29.0 / 5 = 5.8

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Life satisfaction' to the average for their gender:

Males:
- Respondent114: 7.0 > 6.33
- Respondent23: 6.0 < 6.33
- Respondent32: 7.0 > 6.33
- Respondent99: 5.0 < 6.33
- Respondent90: 5.0 < 6.33
- Respondent110: 8.0 > 6.33

Females:
- Respondent56: 7.0 > 5.8
- Respondent36: 7.0 > 5.8
- Respondent81: 4.0 < 5.8
- Respondent64: 7.0 > 5.8
- Respondent26: 4.0 < 5.8

Respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender:
- Respondent114
- Respondent32
- Respondent110
- Respondent56
- Respondent36
- Respondent64

The final answer is: $\boxed{Respondent114, Respondent32, Respondent110, Respondent56, Respondent36, Respondent64}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

From the provided data, we can calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females as follows:

1. **Identify Male and Female Respondents and Their Life Satisfaction Scores:**

Males:
- Respondent22: 6.0
- Respondent73: 8.0
- Respondent7: 8.0

Females:
- Respondent64: 7.0
- Respondent142: 7.0
- Respondent78: 9.0
- Respondent53: 5.0
- Respondent133: 6.0
- Respondent131: 4.0
- Respondent49: 2.0

2. **Calculate Average Life Satisfaction for Males and Females:**

Average for Males = (6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 22.0 / 3 = 7.33

Average for Females = (7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 + 4.0 + 2.0) / 7 = 40.0 / 7 = 5.71

3. **Identify Respondents with Life Satisfaction Greater Than the Average for Their Gender:**

For Males (Average = 7.33):
- Respondent73: 8.0 (Greater than 7.33)
- Respondent7: 8.0 (Greater than 7.33)

For Females (Average = 5.71):
- Respondent64: 7.0 (Greater than 5.71)
- Respondent142: 7.0 (Greater than 5.71)
- Respondent78: 9.0 (Greater than 5.71)
- Respondent133: 6.0 (Greater than 5.71)

Thus, the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender are:
Respondent73, Respondent7, Respondent64, Respondent142, Respondent78, Respondent133.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Laughter' for each gender and then find the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

From the questionnaire, we understand that:
- Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
- Laughter is measured on a scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the average Laughter for each gender:

**Male (Gender = 1) Respondents and Their Laughter Scores:**
- Respondent76: 5
- Respondent99: 6
- Respondent29: 4
- Respondent128: 9
- Respondent4: 8
- Respondent93: 6

**Female (Gender = 2) Respondents and Their Laughter Scores:**
- Respondent14: 3
- Respondent62: 8
- Respondent127: 8
- Respondent19: 0
- Respondent136: 3

Now, let's calculate the average Laughter for each gender:

**Average Laughter for Males:**
(5 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 6) / 6 = 38 / 6 = 6.33

**Average Laughter for Females:**
(3 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 3) / 5 = 22 / 5 = 4.4

Next, we identify the respondents whose Laughter is greater than the average for their gender:

**Males with Laughter greater than 6.33:**
- Respondent128: 9
- Respondent4: 8 (does not exceed 6.33, mistake in initial assessment)
- Respondent93: 6 (does not exceed 6.33, mistake in initial assessment)
- Corrected assessment: Only Respondent128 exceeds the average.

**Females with Laughter greater than 4.4:**
- Respondent62: 8
- Respondent127: 8

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender are:
Respondent128, Respondent62, Respondent127.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's mother's years of education to this average for their respective socio-economic status group.

1. **Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:**

From the data provided, we can extract the following information regarding parental education and socio-economic status:

- Respondent100: Socio-economic status 5, Father's education 17 years
- Respondent146: Socio-economic status 2, Father's education 9 years
- Respondent94: Socio-economic status 3, Father's education 16 years
- Respondent140: Socio-economic status 2, Father's education 12 years
- Respondent45: Socio-economic status 5, Father's education 16 years
- Respondent121: Socio-economic status 4, Father's education 25 years
- Respondent19: Socio-economic status 2, Father's education 17 years
- Respondent5: Socio-economic status 6, Father's education 13 years
- Respondent34: No parental education data provided
- Respondent108: No parental education data provided
- Respondent121: Father's education 25 years, socio-economic status 4

Now, let's calculate the average years of education for fathers by socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 2: (9 + 12 + 17) / 3 = 38 / 3 = 12.67 years
- Socio-economic status 3: 16 years (only one data point)
- Socio-economic status 4: 25 years (only one data point)
- Socio-economic status 5: (17 + 16) / 2 = 33 / 2 = 16.5 years
- Socio-economic status 6: 13 years (only one data point)

2. **Compare each respondent's mother's years of education to the average for their socio-economic status group:**

- Respondent100: Mother's education 17 years, socio-economic status 5. Average for fathers in status 5 is 16.5 years. Since 17 > 16.5, Respondent100 qualifies.
- Respondent146: Mother's education 9 years, socio-economic status 2. Average for fathers in status 2 is 12.67 years. Since 9 < 12.67, Respondent146 does not qualify.
- Respondent94: Mother's education 16 years, socio-economic status 3. Average for fathers in status 3 is 16 years. Since 16 = 16, Respondent94 does not qualify because we are looking for more years of education.
- Respondent140: Mother's education 12 years, socio-economic status 2. Average for fathers in status 2 is 12.67 years. Since 12 < 12.67, Respondent140 does not qualify.
- Respondent45: Mother's education 16 years, socio-economic status 5. Average for fathers in status 5 is 16.5 years. Since 16 < 16.5, Respondent45 does not qualify.
- Respondent121: Mother's education 20 years, socio-economic status 4. Average for fathers in status 4 is 25 years. Since 20 < 25, Respondent121 does not qualify.
- Respondent19: Mother's education 19 years, socio-economic status 2. Average for fathers in status 2 is 12.67 years. Since 19 > 12.67, Respondent19 qualifies.
- Respondent5: Mother's education 6 years, socio-economic status 6. Average for fathers in status 6 is 13 years. Since 6 < 13, Respondent5 does not qualify.

**Qualified Respondents:**

- Respondent100
- Respondent19

Therefore, the list of respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

The 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' questions are:
- Anhedonia
- Depressed Mood
- Sleep Problems
- Fatigue
- Appetite Changes
- Feelings of Worthlessness
- Concentration Difficulties
- Psychomotor Changes
- Suicidal Thoughts

Each of these questions has a score from 0 to 3.

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total score by summing the scores of all 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' questions for each respondent.

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Birth Year

We group respondents by their year of birth, calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each, and then find the average score for each birth year group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year

We compare each respondent's total score to the average score of their birth year group and list those with a lower score.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's simplify the process with an example calculation for one respondent and then apply the logic to all respondents.

- **2003**: Respondent56 (3.0), Respondent16 (7.0), Respondent109 (5.0)
- **2004**: Respondent68 (15.0), Respondent129 (3.0)

### Average Scores by Birth Year:

- **2002**: (2.0 + 0.0 + 14.0) / 3 = 16.0 / 3 = 5.33
- **2003**: (3.0 + 7.0 + 5.0) / 3 = 15.0 / 3 = 5.0
- **2004**: (15.0 + 3.0) / 2 = 18.0 / 2 = 9.0

### Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year:

- **2001**: Respondent4 (0.0), Respondent107 (7.0)
- **2002**: Respondent102 (2.0), Respondent130 (0.0)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a 'Enjoyment' score that is lower than the average 'Enjoyment' score for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Enjoyment' score is lower than the average for their respective gender.

From the provided data, we can extract the 'Gender' and 'Enjoyment' scores as follows:

- Male (Gender 1.0): 
  - Respondent22: Enjoyment 5.0
  - Respondent138: Enjoyment 6.0
  - Respondent40: Enjoyment 8.0
  - Respondent72: Enjoyment 6.0
  - Respondent80: Enjoyment 7.0
  - Respondent84: Enjoyment 10.0

- Female (Gender 2.0):
  - Respondent21: Enjoyment 5.0
  - Respondent131: Enjoyment 6.0
  - Respondent53: Enjoyment 5.0
  - Respondent101: Enjoyment 5.0
  - Respondent17: Enjoyment 9.0

Now, let's calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender:

- Average for Male: (5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 10.0) / 6 = 42.0 / 6 = 7.0
- Average for Female: (5.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 + 9.0) / 5 = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

Next, we identify the respondents whose 'Enjoyment' score is lower than the average for their gender:

- For Male (average 7.0): Respondent22 (5.0), Respondent138 (6.0), Respondent72 (6.0), Respondent80 (7.0) does not qualify because it's not lower, it's equal.
- For Female (average 6.0): Respondent21 (5.0), Respondent53 (5.0), Respondent101 (5.0)

Thus, the respondents with an 'Enjoyment' score lower than the average for their gender are:

Respondent22, Respondent138, Respondent72, Respondent21, Respondent53, Respondent101",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

The 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' questions are:
- Anhedonia
- Depressed Mood
- Sleep Problems
- Fatigue
- Appetite Changes
- Feelings of Worthlessness
- Concentration Difficulties
- Psychomotor Changes
- Suicidal Thoughts

Each of these questions has a score from 0 to 3.

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total score by summing the scores of all 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' questions for each respondent.

### Step 2: Identify Birth Year and Calculate Average Score for Each Year

We need to group respondents by their birth year and calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each group.

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of Their Birth Year

For each respondent, we compare their total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score to the average score of all respondents born in the same year.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's simplify the process by directly calculating the necessary information for each respondent and then comparing it to the averages for their respective birth years.

### Calculation:

1. **Respondent112** (2001):
   - Anhedonia: 2
   - Sleep Problems: 1
   - Fatigue: 1
   - Appetite Changes: 2
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 2
   - Concentration Difficulties: 2
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 1
   - Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11

2. **Respondent62** (2003):
   - Anhedonia: 3
   - Sleep Problems: 0
   - Fatigue: 2
   - Appetite Changes: 3
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 3
   - Concentration Difficulties: 3
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 3
   - Total: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17

3. **Respondent15** (2002):
   - Anhedonia: 0
   - Sleep Problems: 1
   - Fatigue: 1
   - Appetite Changes: 0
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 0
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

4. **Respondent63** (2004):
   - Anhedonia: 1
   - Sleep Problems: 0
   - Fatigue: 1
   - Appetite Changes: 1
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 0
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3

   - Anhedonia: 0
   - Sleep Problems: 1
   - Fatigue: 0
   - Appetite Changes: 0
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 1
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2

6. **Respondent30** (2002):
   - Anhedonia: 1
   - Sleep Problems: 0
   - Fatigue: 2
   - Appetite Changes: 0
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 0
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3

   - Anhedonia: 1
   - Sleep Problems: 0
   - Fatigue: 1
   - Appetite Changes: 0
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 0
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

8. **Respondent80** (2002):
   - Anhedonia: 2
   - Sleep Problems: 1
   - Fatigue: 1
   - Appetite Changes: 0
   - Feelings of Worthlessness: 0
   - Concentration Difficulties: 0
   - Suicidal Thoughts: 0
   - Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4

9. **Respondent45** (2002):

    - Concentration Difficulties: 1
    - Suicidal Thoughts: 3
    - Total: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 15

### Averages by Year:

- **2001**: (11 + 2) / 2 = 13 / 2 = 6.5
- **2002**: (2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 15) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6
- **2003**: (17 + 2) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5
- **2004**: 3 (only one respondent)

### Comparison:

- **2001**: Respondent112 (11) is above the average, Respondent23 (2) is below.
- **2002**: Respondent15 (2), Respondent30 (3), and Respondent80 (4) are below the average.
- **2003**: Respondent117 (2) is below the average, Respondent62 (17) is above.
- **2004**: Only one respondent, so no comparison.

Respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for their birth year are:
- Respondent23 (2001)
- Respondent15 (2002)
- Respondent30 (2002)
- Respondent80 (2002)
- Respondent117 (2003)

Therefore, the respondents who meet the criteria are: Respondent23, Respondent15, Respondent30, Respondent80, Respondent117.",False
