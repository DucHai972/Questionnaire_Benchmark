<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all  male respondents born before 2004.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the male respondents who were born before 2004.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of the respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female, where 1 corresponds to Male.

Looking at the 'responses' section:
- Respondent ""7"" was born in 2004 and is Male, but since they were not born before 2004, they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""23"" was born in 2001 and is Male, meeting the criteria.
- Respondent ""91"" was born in 2005 and is Male, but since they were not born before 2004, they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""142"" was born in 2004 and is Female, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""24"" was born in 2004 and is Female, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""84"" was born in 2002 and is Male, meeting the criteria.

Therefore, the male respondents born before 2004 are respondents ""23"" and ""84"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2003.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check two conditions: 

1. The respondent's gender is female, which corresponds to the code ""2.0"" in the ""Gender"" question of the schema.
2. The respondent's year of birth is before 2003.

Given the data, we can identify the female respondents born before 2003 as follows:

- Respondent ""144"" is female (Gender: 2.0) and born in 2004, so she does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""147"" is female (Gender: 2.0) and born in 2003, so she does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""134"" is female (Gender: 2.0) and born in 2003, so she does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""44"" is female (Gender: 2.0) and born in 2003, so she does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""98"" is female (Gender: 2.0) and born in 2003, so she does not meet the criteria.

None of the respondents in the data provided meet both criteria of being female and born before 2003. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all  male respondents born before 2004.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the male respondents born before 2004.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of the respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female, where 1 corresponds to Male and 2 corresponds to Female.

We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check their ""Year of birth"" and ""Gender"". If the ""Year of birth"" is less than 2004 and the ""Gender"" is 1 (Male), we will include the respondent's ID in our list.

Respondents born before 2004 and identified as male are:
- Respondent ""77"" with a birth year of 2002 and gender 1 (Male)
- Respondent ""51"" with a birth year of 2002 and gender 2 (Female), so this respondent is not included.
- Respondent ""108"" with a birth year of 2001 and gender 2 (Female), so this respondent is not included.
- Respondent ""20"" with a birth year of 2003 and gender 1 (Male)
- Respondent ""93"" with a birth year of 2003 and gender 1 (Male)

Therefore, the list of male respondents born before 2004 is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  male respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the male respondents who were born before 2002.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of each respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question where 1 represents ""Male"" and 2 represents ""Female"".

We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check their ""Year of birth"" and ""Gender"". If the ""Year of birth"" is less than 2002 and the ""Gender"" is 1 (representing ""Male""), we will include the respondent's ID in our list.

Given the data, the respondents who match the criteria are:
- Respondent ""94"" with a ""Year of birth"" of 2001 and ""Gender"" of 2 (which actually represents ""Female"", so this respondent does not match the criteria of being male).
- There are no other respondents with a ""Year of birth"" less than 2002 who are also male.

However, upon re-reading the task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis since the task asks for males born before 2002, and the provided data does not include any males born before 2002. All the mentioned respondents in the initial analysis were born in 2002 or later, and the only one born before 2002 (in 2001) was female.

Thus, based on the given data and the specific criteria of being male and born before 2002, the correct answer would reflect that there are no male respondents in the dataset who meet this condition. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{94}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  male respondents born before 2003.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the male respondents who were born before 2003.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of the respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female, where 1 corresponds to Male and 2 corresponds to Female.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find the male respondents born before 2003:

1. Respondent ""140"" - Born in 2001, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
2. Respondent ""47"" - Born in 2003, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
3. Respondent ""141"" - Born in 2004, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
4. Respondent ""7"" - Born in 2004, Gender = 1.0 (Male)
5. Respondent ""119"" - Born in 2002, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
6. Respondent ""54"" - Born in 2004, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
7. Respondent ""113"" - Born in 2002, Gender = 2.0 (Female)
8. Respondent ""75"" - Born in 2003, Gender = 1.0 (Male)

However, upon re-examining the data, we notice that:
- Respondent ""7"" was born in 2004, which is not before 2003.
- Respondent ""75"" was born in 2003, which is not before 2003.

The correct male respondents born before 2003 are not found in the initial analysis due to an oversight in interpreting the gender and birth year correctly for each respondent. Let's correct this:

1. Respondent ""7"" - Born in 2004, Gender = 1.0 (Male) - Not born before 2003.
2. Respondent ""75"" - Born in 2003, Gender = 1.0 (Male) - Not born before 2003.
3. Respondent ""119"" - Born in 2002, Gender = 2.0 (Female) - Incorrectly identified as female.
4. Respondent ""113"" - Born in 2002, Gender = 2.0 (Female) - Incorrectly identified as female.

Correcting the analysis based on the actual data provided and the task's requirements:

- The only male respondents are ""7"" and ""75"", but they were not born before 2003.
- Upon a detailed review, it appears there was an error in identifying males born before 2003 based on the provided data. The correct approach should involve identifying respondents with Gender = 1.0 (Male) and ""Year of birth"" less than 2003.

Given the data and correcting for the task's specific request:
- None of the respondents listed as male (""7"" and ""75"") meet the birth year criterion of being born before 2003, as ""7"" was born in 2004 and ""75"" in 2003.

Thus, based on the provided data and the specific criteria of being male and born before 2003, the list of respondents that meet this criterion is actually empty because the males identified (""7"" and ""75"") do not fulfill the birth year requirement.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Year of birth' is between 2002 and 2005.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Year of birth' is between 2002 and 2005, we need to look at the 'responses' section of the data and filter based on the 'Year of birth' field.


After examining the data, the respondents with a 'Year of birth' between 2002 and 2005 are:


115, 96, 101, 119, 129, 39, 89, 7


These respondents have years of birth as follows:


- 115: 2004

- 119: 2002
- 129: 2004
- 39: 2005
- 89: 2002
- 7: 2004


Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Year of birth' is between 2002 and 2005 is: 115, 96, 101, 119, 129, 39, 89, 7.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2003.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the female respondents who were born before 2003.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of the respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female.

We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section, check their gender and year of birth, and list those who are female and born before 2003.

Respondents and their details:
1. Respondent 27 - Female, born in 2003.
2. Respondent 76 - Male, born in 2006.
3. Respondent 107 - Male, born in 2001.
4. Respondent 22 - Male, born in 2003.
5. Respondent 30 - Male, born in 2002.
6. Respondent 37 - Female, born in 2004.
7. Respondent 90 - Male, born in 2002.
8. Respondent 80 - Male, born in 2002.
9. Respondent 88 - Male, born in 2001.
10. Respondent 117 - Male, born in 2003.
11. Respondent 53 - Female, born in 2004.
12. Respondent 134 - Female, born in 2003.

Female respondents born before 2003: None are listed as the provided data does not include any female respondents born before 2003. 

However, based on the given data, the female respondents are:
- Respondent 27 (born in 2003)
- Respondent 37 (born in 2004)
- Respondent 53 (born in 2004)
- Respondent 134 (born in 2003)

But since the task is to list female respondents born before 2003, and there are no females born before 2003 in the data provided, the answer would be that there are no female respondents who meet this criterion. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the female respondents born before 2002.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Year of birth"" question provides the birth year of the respondent.
- The ""Gender"" question is a multiple-choice question with options 1 for Male and 2 for Female.

We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check their ""Year of birth"" and ""Gender"". We are looking for respondents with a ""Gender"" of 2 (Female) and a ""Year of birth"" less than 2002.

Respondents and their details:
- ""2"": Born in 2001, Female
- ""17"": Born in 1999, Female
- ""48"": Born in 1999, Female
- ""94"": Born in 2001, Female

These are the female respondents born before 2002. Thus, the list of respondents that match the criteria is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check two conditions: 

1. The respondent's gender is female, which corresponds to the code ""2.0"" in the ""Gender"" field of the 'questions' schema.
2. The respondent's year of birth is before 2002.

Based on the provided data, we will list the IDs of the respondents who meet these conditions.


After analyzing the data:


The female respondents born before 2002 are:


None of the respondents meet the condition of being female and born before 2002 except for respondent ""100"" who is indeed female (Gender: 1.0, which corresponds to male in the example but female in this context is actually 2.0) and born in 1999 (Year of birth: 1999.0). However, given the context and usual gender coding (1 for Male, 2 for Female), it seems there was an initial confusion. Respondent ""100"" is actually male according to the example's gender coding but considering standard practices, the coding might be misunderstood. Given the task's specifics and correcting for the standard interpretation where 1 = Male and 2 = Female, we should look for females (code 2) born before 2002.


Actually, there is no female respondent born before 2002 based on the standard gender coding interpretation (1 = Male, 2 = Female). The initial interpretation was incorrect based on the example provided.


Correcting the analysis with proper gender coding (1 = Male, 2 = Female), we find:


Respondent ""100"" is male, not female, according to the provided example's coding. Thus, we need to correctly identify females born before 2002.


Given this, the actual task is to find females (Gender = 2.0) born before 2002, and based on the data provided, there are no respondents that fit this description correctly under the standard coding assumption.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all  female respondents born before 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check two conditions: 

1. The respondent's gender is female.
2. The respondent was born before 2002.

According to the 'questions' schema, the gender question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". Therefore, a female respondent will have a ""Gender"" answer of 2.0.

We will go through each respondent and apply these conditions:

- Respondent ""118"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2005.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""45"": Gender = 1.0 (Male), Year of birth = 2002.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""77"": Gender = 1.0 (Male), Year of birth = 2002.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""22"": Gender = 1.0 (Male), Year of birth = 2003.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""35"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2001.0 (before 2002).
- Respondent ""81"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2002.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""31"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2002.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""62"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2003.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""79"": Gender = 2.0 (Female), Year of birth = 2004.0 (not before 2002).
- Respondent ""30"": Gender = 1.0 (Male), Year of birth = 2002.0 (not before 2002).

Only respondent ""35"" meets both conditions (female and born before 2002).

The final answer is: 35",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined 'Stress' and 'Loneliness' score is exactly 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2002 have a 'Happiness' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 3?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check if they meet the specified criteria: being male (Gender = 1.0), born after 2002, having a 'Happiness' score of 6, and a 'Depression' score of less than 3.

Given the data, let's analyze each respondent:

1. Respondent ""14"" - Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
2. Respondent ""92"" - Born in 2003, so after 2002. Gender is 2.0 (Female), so does not meet the gender criterion.
3. Respondent ""3"" - Born in 1998, so not after 2002.
4. Respondent ""125"" - Born in 2004, so after 2002. Gender is 1.0 (Male), Happiness score is 8 (not 6), so does not meet the Happiness criterion.
5. Respondent ""35"" - Born in 2001, so not after 2002.
6. Respondent ""50"" - Born in 2003, so after 2002. Gender is 2.0 (Female), so does not meet the gender criterion.
7. Respondent ""99"" - Born in 2001, so not after 2002.
8. Respondent ""144"" - Born in 2004, so after 2002. Gender is 2.0 (Female), so does not meet the gender criterion.
9. Respondent ""130"" - Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
10. Respondent ""127"" - Born in 2004, so after 2002. Gender is 2.0 (Female), so does not meet the gender criterion.
11. Respondent ""105"" - Born in 2002, so not after 2002.
12. Respondent ""126"" - Born in 2005, so after 2002. Gender is 1.0 (Male), Happiness score is 6, and Depression score is 0 (less than 3), so meets all criteria.

Therefore, the male respondent born after 2002 with a 'Happiness' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 3 is respondent ""126"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12, we need to calculate the total score for each respondent and then filter those with scores greater than 12.


The 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' section has the following questions:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which  female respondents born after 2004 have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are no female respondents born after 2004 who have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 and a 'Depression' score of less than 4.


However, we can find the respondents who match some of the conditions:


- Respondent 118 is a female born in 2005, but her 'Life satisfaction' score is 6 and her 'Depression' score is 1, which matches the conditions.
- Respondent 127 is a female born in 2004, but her 'Life satisfaction' score is 8, which does not match the conditions.
- Respondent 141 is a female born in 2004, but her 'Life satisfaction' score is 8, which does not match the conditions.
- Respondent 29 is a male born in 2004, so does not match the gender condition.
- Respondent 131 is a female born in 2003, so does not match the birth year condition.
- Respondent 147 is a female born in 2003, so does not match the birth year condition.


Respondent 118 matches all the given conditions, but since the question asks for female respondents and the gender of respondent 118 is actually female (Gender: 2.0), we should include her in the list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' is greater than 12, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data.


After calculating the total score for 'Emotional Regulation Frequency' for each respondent, we can identify the respondents with a total score greater than 12.


Here are the calculations:


- Respondent 75: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 15
- Respondent 147: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12
- Respondent 69: 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10
- Respondent 132: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 16
- Respondent 25: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2004 have a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 and a 'Loneliness' score of less than 3?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check if they meet the specified criteria: being male, born after 2004, having a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8, and a 'Loneliness' score of less than 3.

Given the data, we can start by filtering the respondents based on the 'Gender' field, which is represented by a number where 1.0 corresponds to Male and 2.0 corresponds to Female. We are interested in males, so we look for 'Gender': 1.0.

Next, we filter by the 'Year of birth' being after 2004, which means we are looking for values greater than 2004.

Then, we check the 'Life satisfaction' score, which needs to be exactly 8.0.

Finally, we check the 'Loneliness' score, which needs to be less than 3.0.

Let's examine the data provided:

1. Respondent ""38"" - Male, born in 2004, 'Life satisfaction' is 10.0, and 'Loneliness' is 0.0. Does not meet the 'Year of birth' and 'Life satisfaction' criteria.
2. Respondent ""83"" - Male, born in 2004, 'Life satisfaction' is 6.0, and 'Loneliness' is 10.0. Does not meet the 'Year of birth', 'Life satisfaction', and 'Loneliness' criteria.
3. Respondent ""126"" - Male, born in 2005, 'Life satisfaction' is 8.0, and 'Loneliness' is 0.0. Meets all criteria.
4. Respondent ""148"" - Male, born in 2002, 'Life satisfaction' is 7.0, and 'Loneliness' is 1.0. Does not meet the 'Year of birth' and 'Life satisfaction' criteria.
5. Respondent ""69"" - Male, born in 2003, 'Life satisfaction' is 4.0, and 'Loneliness' is 10.0. Does not meet the 'Life satisfaction' and 'Loneliness' criteria.
6. Respondent ""107"" - Male, born in 2001, 'Life satisfaction' is 6.0, and 'Loneliness' is 8.0. Does not meet the 'Year of birth', 'Life satisfaction', and 'Loneliness' criteria.

From the provided data, only respondent ""126"" meets all the specified criteria.

The final answer is: 126",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which  male respondents born after 2003 have a 'Laughter' score of 7 and a 'Worry' score of less than 4?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check if they meet the specified criteria: being male, born after 2003, having a 'Laughter' score of 7, and a 'Worry' score of less than 4.

Given the data, we can start by filtering the respondents based on the 'Gender' field, which is represented by a number where 1.0 corresponds to Male and 2.0 corresponds to Female. We are interested in males, so we look for 'Gender': 1.0. Then, we check the 'Year of birth' to ensure it's after 2003. After that, we verify the 'Laughter' score is exactly 7.0 and the 'Worry' score is less than 4.0.

Let's examine the data provided:

1. Respondent ""127"" - Female, born in 2004, 'Laughter' score of 8.0, and 'Worry' score of 1.0. Does not meet the gender and laughter score criteria.
2. Respondent ""69"" - Male, born in 2003, 'Laughter' score of 3.0, and 'Worry' score of 1.0. Does not meet the birth year and laughter score criteria.
3. Respondent ""83"" - Male, born in 2004, 'Laughter' score of 1.0, and 'Worry' score of 1.0. Does not meet the laughter score criterion.
4. Respondent ""73"" - Male, born in 2003, 'Laughter' score of 9.0, and 'Worry' score of 1.0. Does not meet the birth year and laughter score criteria.
5. Respondent ""87"" - Male, born in 2003, 'Laughter' score of 6.0, and 'Worry' score of 2.0. Does not meet the birth year and laughter score criteria.
6. Respondent ""141"" - Female, born in 2004, 'Laughter' score of 1.0, and 'Worry' score of 3.0. Does not meet the gender and laughter score criteria.
7. Respondent ""148"" - Male, born in 2002, 'Laughter' score of 7.0, and 'Worry' score of 1.0. Does not meet the birth year criterion.
8. Respondent ""34"" - Male, born in 2003, 'Laughter' score of 9.0, and 'Worry' score of 0.0. Does not meet the birth year and laughter score criteria.
9. Respondent ""145"" - Female, born in 2022, 'Laughter' score of 4.0, and 'Worry' score of 2.0. Does not meet the gender and laughter score criteria.

Upon reviewing the provided data again for accuracy in filtering based on the specified criteria (male, born after 2003, 'Laughter' score of 7, and 'Worry' score less than 4), it appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the precise matching of all criteria for each respondent.

Given the detailed criteria:
- Male respondents are those with 'Gender': 1.0.
- Born after 2003 means 'Year of birth' > 2003.
- 'Laughter' score of 7 means the value for 'Laughter' is exactly 7.0.
- 'Worry' score of less than 4 means the value for 'Worry' is less than 4.0.

Upon re-examination, none of the respondents perfectly match all the given criteria as described. The initial task was to identify male respondents born after 2003 with a 'Laughter' score of 7 and a 'Worry' score of less than 4. Given the data provided and the strict criteria, there are no respondents that meet all these conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, the correct answer, based on the provided data and the specified criteria, is that there are no male respondents who meet all the conditions. However, the format requires a specific type of output which typically would list respondent IDs. Since no respondents meet the criteria, the output should reflect the absence of matching respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the condition.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
2. For each respondent, check if their mother's years of education exceed the average years of education for fathers in their socio-economic status group.
3. List the respondents who meet the condition.

Let's start by calculating the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:

- Socio-economic status 1: Fathers' education = (None + None + 11 + 17) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7
- Socio-economic status 2: Fathers' education = (15 + 4 + 17) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12
- Socio-economic status 4: Fathers' education = (25) / 1 = 25
- Socio-economic status 5: Fathers' education = (19 + 18) / 2 = 37 / 2 = 18.5
- Socio-economic status 6: Fathers' education = (22 + 28) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, let's compare each mother's education to the average for fathers in their respective socio-economic status groups:

- Respondent 20: Socio-economic status 6, Mother's education = 28, Average for fathers = 25. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 34: Socio-economic status 6, No mother's education data.
- Respondent 58: Socio-economic status 1, No mother's education data.
- Respondent 133: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education = None, Does not meet the condition because there's no data.
- Respondent 114: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education = 11, Average for fathers = 7. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 3: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education = 5, Average for fathers = 12. Does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 88: Socio-economic status 4, Mother's education = 25, Average for fathers = 25. Does not meet the condition because it's not more than the average.
- Respondent 31: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education = 15, Average for fathers = 12. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 109: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education = 23, Average for fathers = 18.5. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 123: Socio-economic status 5, Mother's education = 18, Average for fathers = 18.5. Does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 19: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education = 19, Average for fathers = 12. Meets the condition.

The respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the condition.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
2. For each respondent, check if their mother's years of education exceed the average for fathers in their socio-economic status group.
3. List the respondents who meet this condition.

Let's start by calculating the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:

- Socio-economic status 2: 
  - Respondent 27: Father's education = 17 years
  - No other respondents in this group have reported father's education, so the average is 17 years.

- Socio-economic status 3: 
  - Respondent 99: Father's education = 11 years
  - Respondent 81: Father's education = 11 years
  - Respondent 77: No father's education reported
  - Respondent 36: No father's education reported
  - Respondent 98: No father's education reported
  - Respondent 35: Father's education = 13 years
  - Average = (11 + 11 + 13) / 3 = 35 / 3 = 11.67 years

- Socio-economic status 5: 
  - Respondent 23: Father's education = 22 years
  - Respondent 95: No father's education reported
  - Average = 22 years (since only one respondent reported)

Now, let's compare each mother's years of education to the average for fathers in their respective socio-economic status groups:

- Respondent 27 (Socio-economic status 2): Mother's education = 11 years, Average for fathers = 17 years. Does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 99 (Socio-economic status 3): Mother's education = 11 years, Average for fathers = 11.67 years. Does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 23 (Socio-economic status 5): Mother's education = 25 years, Average for fathers = 22 years. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 81 (Socio-economic status 3): Mother's education = 20 years, Average for fathers = 11.67 years. Meets the condition.
- Respondent 95 (Socio-economic status 5): No mother's education reported.
- Respondent 77 (Socio-economic status 3): No mother's education reported.
- Respondent 36 (Socio-economic status 3): No mother's education reported.
- Respondent 98 (Socio-economic status 3): No mother's education reported.
- Respondent 35 (Socio-economic status 3): Mother's education = 13 years, Average for fathers = 11.67 years. Meets the condition.

The respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the condition.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
2. For each respondent, check if their mother's years of education exceed the average for fathers in their socio-economic status group.
3. List the respondents who meet this condition.

Let's start by calculating the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group based on the provided data:

- Socio-economic status 1: Father's education = 13 (from respondent 136)
- Socio-economic status 2: Father's education = 11 (from respondent 90), 15 (from respondent 3); Average = (11 + 15) / 2 = 13
- Socio-economic status 3: Father's education = 11 (from respondent 113), 11 (from respondent 90); Average = (11 + 11) / 2 = 11
- Socio-economic status 4: Father's education = 17 (from respondent 43), no average to calculate since there's only one data point for fathers.
- Socio-economic status 6: Father's education = No data points for fathers to calculate an average.

Now, let's examine the mothers' education levels and compare them to the averages calculated for fathers in their respective socio-economic status groups:

- Respondent 18: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education = 16. The average for fathers in socio-economic status 3 is 11. Since 16 > 11, respondent 18 meets the condition.
- Respondent 136: Socio-economic status 1, Mother's education = 5. The only father's education in socio-economic status 1 is 13. Since 5 < 13, respondent 136 does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 145: Socio-economic status 3, Mother's education = 15. The average for fathers in socio-economic status 3 is 11. Since 15 > 11, respondent 145 meets the condition.
- Respondent 3: Socio-economic status 2, Mother's education = 5. The average for fathers in socio-economic status 2 is 13. Since 5 < 13, respondent 3 does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 43: Socio-economic status 4, No mother's education data. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 113: Socio-economic status 3, No mother's education data. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 90: Socio-economic status 2, No mother's education data. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 55: Socio-economic status 6, No mother's education data. Cannot be considered.
- Respondent 39: Socio-economic status 4, No mother's education data. Cannot be considered.

Based on the provided data and calculations, the respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group are:

18, 145

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' exceeds this average for their respective gender.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females separately.
2. Identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender.

First, let's calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females.

Males (Gender = 1):
- Respondent 114: Life satisfaction = 7
- Respondent 23: Life satisfaction = 6
- Respondent 32: Life satisfaction = 7
- Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5
- Respondent 90: Life satisfaction = 5
- Respondent 110: Life satisfaction = 8

Total Life satisfaction for males = 7 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 38
Number of males = 6
Average Life satisfaction for males = 38 / 6 = 6.33

Females (Gender = 2):
- Respondent 56: Life satisfaction = 7
- Respondent 26: Life satisfaction = 4
- Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7
- Respondent 81: Life satisfaction = 4
- Respondent 64: Life satisfaction = 7

Total Life satisfaction for females = 7 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 29
Number of females = 5
Average Life satisfaction for females = 29 / 5 = 5.8

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender.

For males (average = 6.33):
- Respondent 114: 7 > 6.33
- Respondent 23: 6 < 6.33
- Respondent 32: 7 > 6.33
- Respondent 99: 5 < 6.33
- Respondent 90: 5 < 6.33
- Respondent 110: 8 > 6.33

For females (average = 5.8):
- Respondent 56: 7 > 5.8
- Respondent 26: 4 < 5.8
- Respondent 36: 7 > 5.8
- Respondent 81: 4 < 5.8
- Respondent 64: 7 > 5.8

Respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender:
- Male: 114, 32, 110
- Female: 56, 36, 64

Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender is 114, 32, 110, 56, 36, 64.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average 'Life satisfaction' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females separately.
2. Identify the respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' greater than the male average.
3. Identify the respondents who are female and have a 'Life satisfaction' greater than the female average.

Let's start by calculating the average 'Life satisfaction' for males and females.

Males:
- Respondent 22: 'Life satisfaction' = 6
- Respondent 73: 'Life satisfaction' = 8
- Respondent 7: 'Life satisfaction' = 8

Females:
- Respondent 64: 'Life satisfaction' = 7
- Respondent 142: 'Life satisfaction' = 7
- Respondent 78: 'Life satisfaction' = 9
- Respondent 53: 'Life satisfaction' = 5
- Respondent 133: 'Life satisfaction' = 6
- Respondent 131: 'Life satisfaction' = 4
- Respondent 49: 'Life satisfaction' = 2

Calculating the averages:

Male average = (6 + 8 + 8) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7.33

Female average = (7 + 7 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 2) / 7 = 40 / 7 = 5.71

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Life satisfaction' is greater than the average for their gender:

Males with 'Life satisfaction' > 7.33:
- Respondent 73: 'Life satisfaction' = 8
- Respondent 7: 'Life satisfaction' = 8

Females with 'Life satisfaction' > 5.71:
- Respondent 64: 'Life satisfaction' = 7
- Respondent 142: 'Life satisfaction' = 7
- Respondent 78: 'Life satisfaction' = 9
- Respondent 133: 'Life satisfaction' = 6 (does not meet the criteria)

The final answer is: $\boxed{7, 73, 64, 142, 78}$",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Laughter' for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average 'Laughter' for Each Gender:**

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is a MCQ with 1. Male and 2. Female. We will calculate the average 'Laughter' for males and females separately.

- **Males (Gender = 1):**
  - Respondent 76: Laughter = 5
  - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6
  - Respondent 29: Laughter = 4
  - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9
  - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8
  - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6
  - Total Laughter for Males = 5 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 6 = 38
  - Number of Males = 6
  - Average Laughter for Males = 38 / 6 = 6.33

- **Females (Gender = 2):**
  - Respondent 14: Laughter = 3
  - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8
  - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8
  - Respondent 19: Laughter = 0
  - Respondent 136: Laughter = 3
  - Total Laughter for Females = 3 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 3 = 22
  - Number of Females = 5
  - Average Laughter for Females = 22 / 5 = 4.4

2. **Identify Respondents with 'Laughter' Greater than the Average for Their Gender:**

- **For Males (Average = 6.33):**
  - Respondent 128: Laughter = 9 (Greater than 6.33)
  - Respondent 4: Laughter = 8 (Greater than 6.33)
  - Respondent 93: Laughter = 6 (Not greater than 6.33)
  - Respondent 99: Laughter = 6 (Not greater than 6.33)
  - Respondent 29: Laughter = 4 (Not greater than 6.33)
  - Respondent 76: Laughter = 5 (Not greater than 6.33)

- **For Females (Average = 4.4):**
  - Respondent 62: Laughter = 8 (Greater than 4.4)
  - Respondent 127: Laughter = 8 (Greater than 4.4)
  - Respondent 14: Laughter = 3 (Not greater than 4.4)
  - Respondent 19: Laughter = 0 (Not greater than 4.4)
  - Respondent 136: Laughter = 3 (Not greater than 4.4)

**Respondents with 'Laughter' greater than the average for their gender are:**
- Male Respondents: 128, 4
- Female Respondents: 62, 127

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Laughter' is greater than the average 'Laughter' for their gender are **128, 4, 62, 127**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose mother has more years of education than the average for all fathers in the same socio-economic status group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of education for all fathers in each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each mother's years of education to this average for her respective socio-economic status group to find the respondents who meet the condition.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group.
2. For each respondent, check if their mother's years of education exceed the average for fathers in their socio-economic status group.
3. List the respondents who meet the condition.

Let's start by calculating the average years of education for fathers in each socio-economic status group:

- Socio-economic status 1: 
  - Respondent 108: Father's education = Not available
  - No average can be calculated for this group due to lack of data.

- Socio-economic status 2: 
  - Respondent 146: Father's education = 9 years
  - Respondent 140: Father's education = 12 years
  - Respondent 19 and 5: Father's education = 17 and 13 years, respectively
  - Average = (9 + 12 + 17 + 13) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75 years

- Socio-economic status 3: 
  - Respondent 94: Father's education = 16 years
  - No other data available for this group, so we cannot calculate an average.

- Socio-economic status 4: 
  - Respondent 121: Father's education = 25 years
  - No other data available for this group, so we cannot calculate an average.

- Socio-economic status 5: 
  - Respondent 100: Father's education = 17 years
  - Respondent 45: Father's education = 16 years
  - Average = (17 + 16) / 2 = 33 / 2 = 16.5 years

- Socio-economic status 6: 
  - Respondent 34: No father's education data
  - Respondent 5: Father's education = 13 years (Incorrectly assumed in initial calculation; actually, respondent 5's mother's education is compared, and the father's education is 13, but this respondent is in socio-economic status 6)
  - Correcting the approach: We should directly compare the available data without incorrect assumptions.

Given the complexities and the need for precise calculation based on the provided data, let's correct and simplify the approach focusing on the actual task:

1. Identify the socio-economic status of each respondent.
2. Calculate the average father's education for each socio-economic status group where data is available.
3. Compare each mother's education to the average father's education in her socio-economic status group.

However, due to the oversight in the initial steps and the complexity of recalculating averages with the correct methodology, the accurate approach involves directly comparing the mother's education to the average father's education within the same socio-economic group for each respondent. 

Given the data and the need for a precise answer, let's directly address the task with the correct methodology:

- For socio-economic status 2, the average father's education is 12.75 years. 
  - Respondent 146 (Mother's education = 9 years), 140 (Mother's education = 12 years), 19 (Mother's education = 19 years), and 5 (Mother's education = 6 years) are in this group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores of ""Anhedonia"", ""Depressed Mood"", ""Sleep Problems"", ""Fatigue"", ""Appetite Changes"", ""Feelings of Worthlessness"", ""Concentration Difficulties"", ""Psychomotor Changes"", and ""Suicidal Thoughts"" under ""Depressive Symptoms Frequency"".

2. **Find the Average Score for Respondents Born in Each Year:**
   - Group respondents by their year of birth.
   - For each year, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average for Their Birth Year:**
   - Compare each respondent's total score with the average score for their birth year.
   - List the respondents whose score is lower than the average.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores

Calculating the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent:

- Respondent 18: 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 12
- Respondent 4: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
- Respondent 68: 3 + (missing ""Depressed Mood"") + 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 + (missing ""Psychomotor Changes"") + 0 = Assuming ""Depressed Mood"" and ""Psychomotor Changes"" are 0 for calculation purposes: 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12
- Respondent 56: 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
- Respondent 11: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 11
- Respondent 16: 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 7
- Respondent 102: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
- Respondent 130: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
- Respondent 74: 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 17
- Respondent 129: 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
- Respondent 107: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7
- Respondent 109: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 5

### Step 2: Calculate Average Scores by Year of Birth

- **2001:** (12 + 0) / 2 = 6
- **2002:** (2 + 0 + 17) / 3 = 19/3 = 6.33
- **2003:** (3 + 7 + 5) / 3 = 15/3 = 5
- **2004:** (12 + 3) / 2 = 15/2 = 7.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Lower Than Average Scores

- **2001:** Respondent 4 (Score: 0)
- **2002:** Respondent 102 (Score: 2), Respondent 130 (Score: 0)
- **2003:** Respondent 56 (Score: 3), Respondent 16 (Score: 7), Respondent 109 (Score: 5)
- **2004:** Respondent 129 (Score: 3)

Thus, the respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for their birth year are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a 'Enjoyment' score that is lower than the average 'Enjoyment' score for their gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender and then identify the respondents whose 'Enjoyment' score is lower than the average for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate the average 'Enjoyment' score for each gender:**

   - **Male (Gender = 1):** 
     - Respondent 22: Enjoyment = 5
     - Respondent 138: Enjoyment = 6
     - Respondent 40: Enjoyment = 8
     - Respondent 72: Enjoyment = 6
     - Respondent 80: Enjoyment = 7
     - Respondent 84: Enjoyment = 10
     - Total Enjoyment for Males = 5 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 10 = 42
     - Number of Male Respondents = 6
     - Average Enjoyment for Males = Total Enjoyment for Males / Number of Male Respondents = 42 / 6 = 7

   - **Female (Gender = 2):** 
     - Respondent 21: Enjoyment = 5
     - Respondent 131: Enjoyment = 6
     - Respondent 53: Enjoyment = 5
     - Respondent 101: Enjoyment = 5
     - Respondent 17: Enjoyment = 9
     - Total Enjoyment for Females = 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 9 = 30
     - Number of Female Respondents = 5
     - Average Enjoyment for Females = Total Enjoyment for Females / Number of Female Respondents = 30 / 5 = 6

2. **Identify respondents with 'Enjoyment' score lower than the average for their gender:**

   - **Males with Enjoyment < 7:**
     - Respondent 22: Enjoyment = 5 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 138: Enjoyment = 6 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 40: Enjoyment = 8 (Not lower than average)
     - Respondent 72: Enjoyment = 6 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 80: Enjoyment = 7 (Not lower than average, exactly average)
     - Respondent 84: Enjoyment = 10 (Not lower than average)

   - **Females with Enjoyment < 6:**
     - Respondent 21: Enjoyment = 5 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 131: Enjoyment = 6 (Not lower than average, exactly average)
     - Respondent 53: Enjoyment = 5 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 101: Enjoyment = 5 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 17: Enjoyment = 9 (Not lower than average)

**Respondents with 'Enjoyment' score lower than the average for their gender:**

- Males: 22, 138, 72
- Females: 21, 53, 101

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score that is lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent, then find the average score for respondents born in each year, and finally identify which respondents have a score lower than the average for their birth year.

The 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' section in the questionnaire has 8 sub-questions, each scored from 0 to 3. We will sum these scores for each respondent to get their total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's break down the steps and calculate:

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each respondent:**

   - Respondent 112: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11
   - Respondent 62: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17
   - Respondent 15: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
   - Respondent 63: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
   - Respondent 23: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
   - Respondent 30: 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
   - Respondent 117: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2
   - Respondent 80: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4
   - Respondent 45: 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6
   - Respondent 31: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 15

2. **Identify the birth year for each respondent and calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score for each year:**

   - 2001: Respondents 112 (score = 11) and 23 (score = 2). Average = (11 + 2) / 2 = 6.5
   - 2002: Respondents 15 (score = 2), 63 is actually born in 2004 (mistake in initial calculation), 30 (score = 3), 80 (score = 4), 45 (score = 6), and 31 (score = 15, but 31 is female). Corrected list for 2002: 15, 30, 80, 45. Average = (2 + 3 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 3.75
   - 2003: Respondents 62 (score = 17) and 117 (score = 2). Average = (17 + 2) / 2 = 9.5
   - 2004: Respondent 63 (score = 3). Average = 3 (since there's only one respondent)

3. **Identify respondents with a score lower than the average for their birth year:**

   - 2001: Respondent 23 (score = 2) is lower than the average of 6.5.
   - 2002: Respondents 15 (score = 2) and 30 (score = 3) are lower than the average of 3.75.
   - 2003: Respondent 117 (score = 2) is lower than the average of 9.5.
   - 2004: Since the average is the score of the only respondent, there's no one lower than the average.

Thus, the respondents with a total 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' score lower than the average for all respondents born in the same year are 23, 15, 30, and 117.",False
