</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same education level as respondent '29043'.
</task>","To determine the education level of respondent '29043', we first look at their response. Respondent 29043 has an 'EdLevel' of 'A', which according to the 'questions' schema, corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school'. 

Now, we need to find all respondents who also have an 'EdLevel' of 'A'. 

Respondents with 'EdLevel' 'A' are: 492, 29071, 72700, 72741, 72869, 73007.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same education level as respondent '388'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same education level as respondent '388', we first need to identify the education level of respondent '388'. According to the responses, respondent '388' has an EdLevel of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school' based on the questions schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find other respondents with the same EdLevel 'A'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' (professional identity) as respondent '297'?
</task>","To determine which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '297', we first need to identify the 'MainBranch' of respondent '297'. According to the responses, respondent '297' has a 'MainBranch' of 'A', which corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"" based on the 'questions' schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with 'MainBranch' as 'A'.

Respondents with 'MainBranch' 'A' are: 
72981, 73015, 347, 72793, 73017, 469, 332, 72823, 297.

Since we are looking for respondents with the same 'MainBranch' as '297', and '297' is one of them, we exclude '297' from the list because the question asks for ""other"" respondents with the same 'MainBranch'. 

Thus, the list of respondents with the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '297' is: 
72981, 73015, 347, 72793, 73017, 469, 332, 72823.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' (professional identity) as respondent '73047'?
</task>","To determine which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '73047', we first need to identify the 'MainBranch' of respondent '73047'. According to the responses, respondent '73047' has a 'MainBranch' of 'A', which corresponds to 'I am a developer by profession' based on the questions schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with 'MainBranch' as 'A'.

Respondents with 'MainBranch' 'A' are: 
73051, 268, 373, 73129, 73047, 73191, 73219, 73020.

Since the task is to find respondents with the same 'MainBranch' as '73047', and '73047' is also included in the list, the list of respondents (excluding '73047' itself as the comparison point) with the same 'MainBranch' is:
73051, 268, 373, 73129, 73191, 73219, 73020.

The final answer is: 73051, 268, 373, 73129, 73191, 73219, 73020.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' (professional identity) as respondent '72856'?
</task>","To determine which respondents have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '72856', we first need to identify the 'MainBranch' of respondent '72856'. According to the responses, respondent '72856' has a 'MainBranch' of 'A', which corresponds to 'I am a developer by profession' based on the questions schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with 'MainBranch' as 'A'.

Respondent 73084: MainBranch - A
Respondent 72858: MainBranch - A
Respondent 72921: MainBranch - A
Respondent 72856: MainBranch - A
Respondent 73219: MainBranch - A
Respondent 73069: MainBranch - A
Respondent 73018: MainBranch - A

All these respondents have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '72856'. Therefore, the list of respondents with the same 'MainBranch' is:

73084, 72858, 72921, 72856, 73219, 73069, 73018",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same education level as respondent '203'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same education level as respondent '203', we first need to identify the education level of respondent '203'. According to the responses, respondent '203' has an EdLevel of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school' based on the questions schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have an EdLevel of 'A'.

Respondent 72762: EdLevel - A
Respondent 501: EdLevel - A
Respondent 73043: EdLevel - A
Respondent 72824: EdLevel - A
Respondent 491: EdLevel - A
Respondent 203: EdLevel - A
Respondent 72856: EdLevel - A
Respondent 349: EdLevel - A

The only respondent who does not have an EdLevel of 'A' is respondent '73153', who has an EdLevel of 'B', corresponding to 'Secondary school'.

Therefore, the list of respondents with the same education level as respondent '203' (Primary/elementary school) is:

72762, 501, 73043, 72824, 491, 203, 72856, 349",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondents are from the same country as respondent '154' and also have more than 7 years of coding experience?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the country of respondent '154' and then find other respondents who are from the same country and have more than 7 years of coding experience.

According to the responses, respondent '154' is from 'Poland'. 

Now, let's find other respondents who are from 'Poland' and have more than 7 years of coding experience.

After reviewing the responses, we can see that there are no other respondents from 'Poland' with more than 7 years of coding experience apart from respondent '154'. 

Therefore, the answer is: None, or more specifically for the format required: there are no respondents that match the criteria provided.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '444' and whose programming languages include 'C++'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'MainBranch' of respondent '444' and then find all respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' and also have 'C++' listed as one of their programming languages.

According to the responses, respondent '444' has:
- MainBranch: A

From the questions schema, MainBranch 'A' corresponds to:
- A. I am a developer by profession

Now, we need to find all respondents who are also developers by profession ('MainBranch' = A) and have worked with 'C++' ('LanguageHaveWorkedWith' includes 'C++').

Respondents with 'MainBranch' = A are: 133, 72994, 444, 362, 222.

Among these, the respondents who have worked with 'C++' are:
- Respondent 133: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes C++; 
- Respondent 362: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes C++;

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '444' and whose programming languages include 'C++' are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from the same country as respondent '73030' and also have more than 5 years of coding experience?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the country of respondent '73030' and then find other respondents who share the same country and have more than 5 years of coding experience.

According to the responses, respondent '73030' is from 'Norway'. 

Now, let's examine each respondent to see if they are from Norway and have more than 5 years of coding experience:

1. Respondent 160 - Country: Iran, Islamic Republic of..., YearsCode: 4 (Does not match)
2. Respondent 73050 - Country: United States of America, YearsCode: 4 (Does not match)
3. Respondent 72969 - Country: United States of America, YearsCode: 8 (Does not match country)
4. Respondent 72731 - Country: United States of America, YearsCode: 7 (Does not match country)
5. Respondent 316 - Country: Netherlands, YearsCode: 14 (Does not match country)
6. Respondent 72763 - Country: United States of America, YearsCode: 12 (Does not match country)
7. Respondent 326 - Country: United States of America, YearsCode: 5 (Does not match country and exactly 5 years, not more)
8. Respondent 73030 - This is the reference respondent.

Since none of the other respondents match both criteria (being from Norway and having more than 5 years of coding experience) aside from respondent '73030' itself, and the task is to find respondents other than '73030' who fit these criteria, we find that there are no additional respondents who meet both conditions. 

However, the question asks for respondents who are from the same country as '73030' (Norway) and have more than 5 years of coding experience. Given the data provided, there are no other respondents from Norway with more than 5 years of coding experience listed. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{73050, 72969, 72731, 316, 72763, 326}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from the same country as respondent '29114' and also have more than 7 years of coding experience?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the country of respondent '29114' and then find other respondents who share the same country and have more than 7 years of coding experience.

According to the responses, respondent '29114' is from 'Switzerland'. 

Now, let's find respondents from 'Switzerland' with more than 7 years of coding experience:

- Respondent '29114' has 17 years of coding experience, which is more than 7 years.

There are no other respondents from 'Switzerland' in the provided data. 

Therefore, the respondent from the same country as '29114' and with more than 7 years of coding experience is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who have the same education level as respondent '103' and whose total compensation is over 50000.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the education level of respondent '103' and then find all respondents who share this education level and have a total compensation over 50,000.

According to the responses, respondent '103' has:
- MainBranch: A
- Employment: A
- EdLevel: A
- YearsCode: 18
- YearsCodePro: 5
- ... (other details)

The education level of respondent '103' is 'A'. Referring to the 'questions' section for the meaning of 'A' in EdLevel:
1. EdLevel: EdLevel: Highest level of education [MCQ: A. Primary/elementary school B. Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.) C. Some college/university study without earning a degree D. Associate degree (A.A., A.S., etc.) E. Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., B.Eng., etc.) F. Master's degree (M.A., M.S., M.Eng., MBA, etc.) G. Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.) H. Other doctoral degree (Ph.D., Ed.D., etc.) I. Something else]

So, 'A' corresponds to ""Primary/elementary school"".

Next, we need to find all respondents with EdLevel 'A' (Primary/elementary school) and CompTotal over 50,000.

Going through the responses:
- Respondent 407: EdLevel is C, not A.
- Respondent 29143: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 4700.0, which is less than 50,000.
- Respondent 72827: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 206000.0, which is over 50,000.
- Respondent 73215: EdLevel is D, not A.
- Respondent 103: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 25500.0, which is less than 50,000.
- Respondent 154: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 105000.0, which is over 50,000.
- Respondent 72592: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 40000.0, which is less than 50,000.
- Respondent 73069: EdLevel is B, not A.
- Respondent 547: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 300000000.0, which is over 50,000.
- Respondent 29061: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 60000.0, which is over 50,000.
- Respondent 72873: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 1400.0, which is less than 50,000.
- Respondent 203: EdLevel is A, CompTotal is 4000.0, which is less than 50,000.

The respondents who have the same education level as respondent '103' (Primary/elementary school) and whose total compensation is over 50,000 are:
72827, 154, 547, 29061

Therefore, the answer is: 72827, 154, 547, 29061",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who have the same education level as respondent '247' and whose total compensation is over 50000.
</task>","To find the respondents who have the same education level as respondent '247' and whose total compensation is over 50000, we first need to identify the education level of respondent '247' and then filter the responses based on this criterion along with the total compensation requirement.

Respondent '247' has an EdLevel of 'A', which according to the schema means 'Primary/elementary school'.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with EdLevel 'A' and CompTotal over 50000.

- Respondent 72905: EdLevel is 'A' but CompTotal is 500.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 29111: EdLevel is 'A' and CompTotal is 50000.0, which meets the EdLevel criterion but not the CompTotal criterion since it's exactly 50000, not over.
- Respondent 162: EdLevel is 'A' and CompTotal is 100000.0, which meets both criteria.
- Respondent 73119: EdLevel is 'A' and CompTotal is 188000.0, which meets both criteria.
- Respondent 171: EdLevel is 'B', which does not meet the EdLevel criterion.
- Respondent 430: EdLevel is 'A' but CompTotal is 1100.0, which does not meet the CompTotal criterion.
- Respondent 72796: EdLevel is 'A' but CompTotal is 25000.0, which does not meet the CompTotal criterion.
- Respondent 247: This is the reference respondent, so we exclude it from the results.
- Respondent 157: EdLevel is 'A' and CompTotal is 57600.0, which meets both criteria.
- Respondent 222: EdLevel is 'A' and CompTotal is 917403.0, which meets both criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same education level as respondent '247' (Primary/elementary school) and whose total compensation is over 50000 are: 162, 73119, 157, 222.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '448' and whose programming languages include 'JavaScript'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'MainBranch' of respondent '448' and then find all respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' and also have 'JavaScript' listed as one of their programming languages.

1. **Identify 'MainBranch' of respondent '448':** 
   - Respondent '448' has 'MainBranch: A', which according to the schema means ""I am a developer by profession"".

2. **Find respondents with the same 'MainBranch' (A):** 
   - All respondents listed have 'MainBranch: A', meaning they are all developers by profession.

3. **Identify respondents who have 'JavaScript' as one of their programming languages:**
   - Respondent '29071' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '29122' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '73106' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '343' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '29045' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '448' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '29124' has 'JavaScript' listed.
   - Respondent '540' has 'JavaScript' listed.

4. **List the IDs of these respondents:**
   - The IDs are 29071, 29122, 73106, 343, 29045, 448, 29124, 540.

Therefore, the list of respondents who have the same 'MainBranch' as respondent '448' and whose programming languages include 'JavaScript' is: 29071, 29122, 73106, 343, 29045, 448, 29124, 540.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '423'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '423'. Respondent '423' has an education level of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school'.

1. **Identify respondents with the same education level as respondent '423'**: 
   - Respondent '72928': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '186': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '423': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '29061': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '72843': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '371': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '492': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '73206': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '72873': EdLevel = A
   - Respondent '73140': EdLevel = B (Does not match, skip)

2. **Calculate the total compensation for these respondents**:
   - Respondent '72928': CompTotal = 900000.0
   - Respondent '186': CompTotal = 650000.0
   - Respondent '423': CompTotal = 2600.0
   - Respondent '29061': CompTotal = 60000.0
   - Respondent '72843': CompTotal = 115000.0
   - Respondent '371': CompTotal = 180000.0
   - Respondent '492': CompTotal = 33000.0
   - Respondent '73206': CompTotal = 1500.0
   - Respondent '72873': CompTotal = 1400.0

3. **Calculate the average compensation**:
   Total compensation = 900000.0 + 650000.0 + 2600.0 + 60000.0 + 115000.0 + 180000.0 + 33000.0 + 1500.0 + 1400.0
   Total compensation = 1761500.0
   Number of respondents = 9
   Average compensation = Total compensation / Number of respondents
   Average compensation = 1761500.0 / 9
   Average compensation = 195722.22

4. **Find respondents with total compensation higher than the average**:
   - Respondent '72928': CompTotal = 900000.0 (Higher than average)
   - Respondent '186': CompTotal = 650000.0 (Higher than average)
   - Respondent '423': CompTotal = 2600.0 (Lower than average)
   - Respondent '29061': CompTotal = 60000.0 (Lower than average)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average professional experience for all respondents in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average professional coding experience for all respondents in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'.

1. **Identify relevant respondents**: From the responses, we find respondents who work in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'. These are Respondent 173, Respondent 185.

2. **Calculate average professional coding experience**:
   - Respondent 173 has 2 years of professional coding experience.
   - Respondent 185 has 9 years of professional coding experience.
   - Average = (2 + 9) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.5 years.

3. **Identify respondents with lower than average professional coding experience**:
   - Since Respondent 173 has 2 years of experience, which is less than 5.5 years, they are included.
   - Respondent 185 has 9 years of experience, which is more than 5.5 years, so they are not included.

Given the specific instructions and the data provided, the task requires listing respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average for those in '100 to 499 employees' organizations. Based on the calculations:

The final answer is: $\boxed{173}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average professional experience for all respondents in organizations of size '10,000 or more employees'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average professional coding experience for all respondents in organizations of size '10,000 or more employees'. Then, we will identify respondents with professional coding experience lower than this average.

1. **Identify respondents in organizations of size '10,000 or more employees'**:
   - Respondent 72739 has an organization size of '10,000 or more employees'.

2. **Calculate the average professional coding experience for these respondents**:
   - Since there's only one respondent (72739) with an organization size of '10,000 or more employees', the average years of professional coding experience is 10 years.

3. **List all respondents with professional coding experience lower than the average (10 years)**:
   - Respondent 72734: 2 years
   - Respondent 72763: 1 year
   - Respondent 73208: 4 years
   - Respondent 441: 5 years
   - Respondent 72850: 6 years
   - Respondent 215: 1 year
   - Respondent 29043: 12 years (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent 152: 38 years (does not meet the criteria)

Therefore, the respondents with professional coding experience lower than the average are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '72950'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to determine the education level of respondent '72950' and then calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with that same education level. Afterward, we will identify respondents with higher total compensation than this average.

1. **Determine the education level of respondent '72950':**
   - Respondent '72950' has an EdLevel of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school' according to the schema.

2. **Calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with EdLevel 'A':**
   - Respondents with EdLevel 'A' are: 73096, 72843, 72950, 73093, 72916, 134, 73219.
   - Their total compensations are: 72000.0, 115000.0, 40000.0, 100400.0, 110000.0, 7200.0, 46000.0.
   - Calculate the average: (72000.0 + 115000.0 + 40000.0 + 100400.0 + 110000.0 + 7200.0 + 46000.0) / 7.
   - Average calculation: (72000 + 115000 + 40000 + 100400 + 110000 + 7200 + 46000) = 461600.
   - Average = 461600 / 7 = 65942.86 (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity).

3. **Identify respondents with EdLevel 'A' and total compensation higher than the average:**
   - Average compensation for EdLevel 'A' is approximately 65942.86.
   - Respondents with EdLevel 'A' and compensation higher than the average are:
     - 72843 (CompTotal: 115000.0)
     - 73093 (CompTotal: 100400.0)
     - 72916 (CompTotal: 110000.0)

Therefore, the respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '72950' are: 72843, 73093, 72916.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average professional experience for all respondents in organizations of size '20 to 99 employees'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average professional coding experience for all respondents in organizations of size '20 to 99 employees'. Then, we will identify respondents within this organization size who have professional coding experience lower than this average.

1. **Identify relevant respondents**: We look for respondents with OrgSize = '20 to 99 employees'.

2. **Calculate average YearsCodePro for this group**:
   - Respondent 469: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent 259: YearsCodePro = 4

   Average YearsCodePro = (8 + 4) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6

3. **List respondents with YearsCodePro less than the average**:
   - Since the average is 6, we look for respondents with YearsCodePro < 6 within the same OrgSize.
   - Respondent 259 has YearsCodePro = 4, which is less than 6.

Therefore, the respondent whose professional coding experience is lower than the average for organizations of size '20 to 99 employees' is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73069'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the education level of respondent '73069'.
2. Calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73069'.
3. Identify all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73069' and whose total compensation is higher than the calculated average.

From the provided data, respondent '73069' has an education level of 'B', which corresponds to 'Secondary school (e.g. American high school, German Realschule or Gymnasium, etc.)'.

Next, we calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with an education level of 'B'. 

Respondent '73069' has a total compensation of 42000.0 and an education level of 'B'. 
Respondent '487' has a total compensation of 5000.0 and an education level of 'B'.

The average total compensation for respondents with an education level of 'B' is (42000.0 + 5000.0) / 2 = 23500.0.

Now, we identify respondents with an education level of 'B' and a total compensation higher than 23500.0.

Respondent '73069' has a total compensation of 42000.0, which is higher than 23500.0.

Therefore, the respondent whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73069' is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average professional experience for all respondents in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average professional coding experience for all respondents in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'. Then, we will identify respondents within this organization size category who have professional coding experience lower than this average.

1. **Identify relevant respondents**: From the data, we find respondents in organizations of size '100 to 499 employees'. These are Respondent 72801.

2. **Calculate average professional coding experience**: Since there's only one respondent in this category, the average is simply their years of professional coding experience, which is 8 years for Respondent 72801.

3. **List respondents with lower professional coding experience**: We now need to list all respondents in the '100 to 499 employees' category who have less than 8 years of professional coding experience. Given the data, Respondent 72801 is the only one in this category, and their experience is exactly 8 years, so there are no respondents with less than 8 years of experience in this specific category.

However, the task asks for a list of respondents whose professional coding experience is lower than the average for this specific organization size, which we've determined to be 8 years based on the single respondent in this category. Since there are no other respondents in this category with less than 8 years of experience, and the question does not ask us to consider respondents outside of this specific organization size for the comparison, the list of such respondents within the specified organization size is empty.

But, considering the instruction to follow the format to the letter and the nature of the question, it seems there might be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the comparison and the output format requested. The question essentially asks for respondents within a specific organizational size category with less than the average professional coding experience of that category. Given the singular data point, the direct answer based on the provided data and the specific question asked would reflect the absence of respondents meeting the criteria within the defined organizational size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72801}$",False

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '72965'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to determine the education level of respondent '72965' and then calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with that same education level. Afterward, we will identify respondents with total compensation higher than this average.

1. **Determine the education level of respondent '72965':**
   - Respondent '72965' has an EdLevel of 'A', which according to the schema means 'Primary/elementary school'. However, given the context, it seems more likely that 'A' corresponds to the highest level of education listed for the respondents provided, which would be more appropriately associated with higher education levels such as Bachelor's degree or higher, considering the nature of the survey. But strictly following the provided schema, 'A' is 'Primary/elementary school'.

2. **Calculate the average total compensation for respondents with EdLevel 'A':**
   - We need to sum up the CompTotal for all respondents with EdLevel 'A' and then divide by the number of such respondents.
   - Respondents with EdLevel 'A' are: 72796, 73144, 72837, 73050, 72891, 383, 102, 387, 72897, 72965.
   - Their respective CompTotal values are: 25000.0, 2600000.0, 140000.0, 65000.0, 155000.0, 19000.0, 120000.0, 45000.0, 75000.0, 50000.0.
   - Sum of CompTotal = 25000.0 + 2600000.0 + 140000.0 + 65000.0 + 155000.0 + 19000.0 + 120000.0 + 45000.0 + 75000.0 + 50000.0 = 2901500.0
   - Number of respondents with EdLevel 'A' = 10
   - Average CompTotal = 2901500.0 / 10 = 290150.0

3. **Identify respondents with total compensation higher than the average:**
   - We compare each respondent's CompTotal to the average calculated (290150.0).
   - Respondents with CompTotal higher than 290150.0 are identified based on the comparison.

Given the calculated average and comparing it with the individual CompTotal values:
- Only respondent 73144 with CompTotal of 2600000.0 is higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '72965' are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '547'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the education level of respondent '547'.
2. Calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '547'.
3. Identify all respondents with the same education level as respondent '547' and whose total compensation is higher than the calculated average.

From the provided data, respondent '547' has an education level of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school' according to the schema.

Next, we calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with an education level of 'A'. The respondents with this education level are '73138', '468', '50', '73094', '245', '72741', '72837', and '547'. Their total compensations are '80000.0', '106600.0', '42000.0', '204300.0', '5500000.0', '86000.0', '140000.0', and '300000000.0', respectively.

To find the average, we sum these compensations and divide by the number of respondents:
Average = (80000.0 + 106600.0 + 42000.0 + 204300.0 + 5500000.0 + 86000.0 + 140000.0 + 300000000.0) / 8

Calculating the sum:
80000.0 + 106600.0 = 186600.0
186600.0 + 42000.0 = 228600.0
228600.0 + 204300.0 = 432900.0
432900.0 + 5500000.0 = 5934900.0
5934900.0 + 86000.0 = 6018900.0
6018900.0 + 140000.0 = 6159900.0
6159900.0 + 300000000.0 = 306599900.0

Then, calculating the average:
306599900.0 / 8 = 38324987.5

Now, we identify respondents with the same education level ('A') and whose total compensation is higher than this average (38324987.5). 

From the list, '245' and '547' have total compensations ('5500000.0' and '300000000.0', respectively) higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose total compensation is higher than the average compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '547' are '245, 547'.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

2. Calculate the average total compensation for all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73259'.
3. Identify all respondents with the same education level as respondent '73259' and whose total compensation is higher than the calculated average.

From the responses, we find that respondent '73259' has an education level of 'A', which corresponds to 'Primary/elementary school' according to the schema. However, given the context and the fact that most respondents have an education level of 'A' which seems inconsistent with the description, it's logical to assume 'A' might actually represent the highest or a common education level among the respondents due to the nature of the survey focusing on developers. Since the exact mapping isn't provided and considering the inconsistency, we'll proceed with 'A' as the education level for '73259', understanding it might not directly map to 'Primary/elementary school' as described.

Now, let's calculate the average total compensation for respondents with an education level of 'A':

Respondents with EdLevel 'A':
- Respondent 72939: CompTotal = 6000.0
- Respondent 72821: CompTotal = 5000.0
- Respondent 73259: CompTotal = 130000.0
- Respondent 103: CompTotal = 25500.0
- Respondent 184: CompTotal = 200000.0
- Respondent 72945: CompTotal = 60000.0
- Respondent 72700: CompTotal = 60000.0

Total compensation for EdLevel 'A' = 6000.0 + 5000.0 + 130000.0 + 25500.0 + 200000.0 + 60000.0 + 60000.0 = 461100.0

Number of respondents with EdLevel 'A' = 7

Average total compensation for EdLevel 'A' = Total compensation / Number of respondents = 461100.0 / 7 ≈ 65871.43

Now, we identify respondents with EdLevel 'A' and total compensation higher than the average (65871.43):

- Respondent 73259: CompTotal = 130000.0 (Higher)
- Respondent 184: CompTotal = 200000.0 (Higher)
- Respondent 72945: CompTotal = 60000.0 (Lower)
- Respondent 72700: CompTotal = 60000.0 (Lower)
- Respondent 103: CompTotal = 25500.0 (Lower)
- Respondent 72939: CompTotal = 6000.0 (Lower)
- Respondent 72821: CompTotal = 5000.0 (Lower)

Respondents with total compensation higher than the average for EdLevel 'A' are:
73259, 184",False
