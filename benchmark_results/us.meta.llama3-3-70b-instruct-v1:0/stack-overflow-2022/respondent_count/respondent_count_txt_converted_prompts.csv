</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 7 years of total coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'YearsCode' field in the 'responses' section, which represents the total years of coding experience for each respondent. We are looking for respondents with more than 7 years of total coding experience.

Let's go through the responses:

1. Respondent 72981: YearsCode = 25 (more than 7)
2. Respondent 73190: YearsCode = 15 (more than 7)
3. Respondent 72744: YearsCode = 7 (not more than 7)

5. Respondent 173: YearsCode = 8 (more than 7)
6. Respondent 73102: YearsCode = 14 (more than 7)
7. Respondent 134: YearsCode = 16 (more than 7)
8. Respondent 259: YearsCode = 7 (not more than 7)
9. Respondent 260: YearsCode = 10 (more than 7)
10. Respondent 72958: YearsCode = 15 (more than 7)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 3 years of total coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'YearsCode' field in the 'responses' section, which represents the total years of coding experience for each respondent. We are looking for respondents with more than 3 years of total coding experience.

Let's go through the responses:

1. Respondent 161: YearsCode - 15 (more than 3)
2. Respondent 539: YearsCode - 10 (more than 3)
3. Respondent 73085: YearsCode - 4 (more than 3)
4. Respondent 72939: YearsCode - 14 (more than 3)
5. Respondent 121: YearsCode - 2 (not more than 3)
6. Respondent 29103: YearsCode - 6 (more than 3)
7. Respondent 60: YearsCode - 9 (more than 3)
8. Respondent 29145: YearsCode - 12 (more than 3)
9. Respondent 73138: YearsCode - 18 (more than 3)
10. Respondent 166: YearsCode - 16 (more than 3)

Counting the respondents with more than 3 years of total coding experience: 
1. Respondent 161
2. Respondent 539
3. Respondent 73085
4. Respondent 72939
5. Respondent 29103
6. Respondent 60
7. Respondent 29145
8. Respondent 73138
9. Respondent 166

There are 9 respondents with more than 3 years of coding experience, but since Respondent 121 has exactly 2 years, which does not meet the criteria, the count remains accurate as it excludes this respondent.

Therefore, the total count of respondents with more than 3 years of total coding experience is 8, excluding Respondent 121 who has 2 years of experience. 

The correct count should be based on the inclusion of all respondents with more than 3 years of experience, which has been accurately identified as 9 respondents. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have worked with the 'SQL' language.
</task>","To accurately count the respondents who have worked with the 'SQL' language, we need to examine the ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field in each respondent's data.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 29067 has worked with SQL.
- Respondent 72825 has worked with SQL.
- Respondent 29048 has worked with SQL.
- Respondent 61 has worked with SQL.

Therefore, the total count of respondents who have worked with the 'SQL' language is 4.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'YearsCodePro' field in the responses, which represents the years of professional coding experience.

After reviewing the data:

- Respondent 334 has 14 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 444 has 16 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72984 has less than 1 year of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 272 has 15 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 166 has 11 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72679 has 14 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72821 has 11 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 206 has 12 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72700 has 6 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 300 has 2 years of professional coding experience.

Counting the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience:

1. Respondent 334
2. Respondent 444
3. Respondent 272
4. Respondent 166
5. Respondent 72679
6. Respondent 72821
7. Respondent 206
8. Respondent 72700

There are 8 respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have used 'npm'.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith' field in the responses, as it contains information about the developer tools used by each respondent.

After reviewing the data, we can see that the following respondents have used 'npm':

- Respondent 29152
- Respondent 72958
- Respondent 72740
- Respondent 29114
- Respondent 73101

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 7 years of professional coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'YearsCodePro' field in the responses, which represents the years of professional coding experience. We are looking for respondents with more than 7 years of professional coding experience.

From the provided responses:

- Respondent 484 has 3 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 491 has 2 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 73136 has 20 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 393 has 11 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 511 has 8 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 29038 has 11 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72978 has 8 years of professional coding experience.

Counting the respondents with more than 7 years of professional coding experience:

1. Respondent 73136 (20 years)
2. Respondent 393 (11 years)
3. Respondent 511 (8 years)
4. Respondent 29038 (11 years)
5. Respondent 72978 (8 years)

There are 5 respondents with more than 7 years of professional coding experience.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are 'C' and whose yearly compensation is over 100000.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents who meet two conditions:

1. Their 'MainBranch' is 'C', indicating they used to be a developer by profession but no longer are.
2. Their 'CompTotal' (Total compensation) is over 100,000.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 394: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 62,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 369: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 90,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 72921: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 5,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 73075: MainBranch is 'B', not 'C', and CompTotal is 166,000.0, which is over 100,000 but does not meet the 'C' criterion.
- Respondent 72837: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 140,000.0, which is over 100,000 but does not meet the 'C' criterion.
- Respondent 73215: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 2,800,000.0, which is over 100,000 but does not meet the 'C' criterion.
- Respondent 73124: MainBranch is 'B', not 'C', and CompTotal is 285,000.0, which is over 100,000 but does not meet the 'C' criterion.
- Respondent 72784: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 80,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 73096: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 72,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 248: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 28,000.0, which is less than 100,000.
- Respondent 444: MainBranch is 'A', not 'C', and CompTotal is 80,000.0, which is less than 100,000.

Upon reviewing the provided responses, there are no respondents whose MainBranch is 'C' and whose yearly compensation (CompTotal) is over 100,000.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are 'A' and whose yearly compensation is over 75000.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents who meet two criteria: 

1. Their 'MainBranch' is 'A', indicating they are developers by profession.
2. Their 'CompTotal' (total compensation) is over 75,000.

Let's examine each respondent:

1. Respondent 73023: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 128000.0 (Meets criteria)
2. Respondent 73121: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 55000.0 (Does not meet criteria due to compensation)
3. Respondent 268: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 130000.0 (Meets criteria)
4. Respondent 72916: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 110000.0 (Meets criteria)
5. Respondent 29105: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 2700.0 (Does not meet criteria due to compensation)
6. Respondent 122: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 104000.0 (Meets criteria)
7. Respondent 29043: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 205000.0 (Meets criteria)
8. Respondent 484: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 160000.0 (Meets criteria)
9. Respondent 72858: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 130000.0 (Meets criteria)
10. Respondent 72915: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 85000.0 (Meets criteria)
11. Respondent 355: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 140000.0 (Meets criteria)
12. Respondent 73254: MainBranch = A, CompTotal = 160000.0 (Meets criteria)

Counting the respondents who meet both criteria: 73023, 268, 72916, 122, 29043, 484, 72858, 72915, 355, 73254.

There are 10 respondents who are 'A' and have a yearly compensation over 75,000.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are 'A' and whose yearly compensation is over 75000.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for two conditions: 

1. Their `MainBranch` must be 'A', indicating they are a developer by profession.
2. Their `CompTotal` (Total compensation) must be over 75,000.

Let's go through the respondents:

1. Respondent 73121: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 55,000.0. Does not meet the compensation criteria.
2. Respondent 73053: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 200,000,000.0. Meets both criteria.
3. Respondent 300: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 1,000,000.0. Meets both criteria.
4. Respondent 487: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 5,000.0. Does not meet the compensation criteria.
5. Respondent 72859: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 102,000.0. Meets both criteria.
6. Respondent 73195: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 180,000.0. Meets both criteria.
7. Respondent 72749: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 100,000.0. Meets both criteria.
8. Respondent 29106: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 33,000.0. Does not meet the compensation criteria.
9. Respondent 29150: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 174,000.0. Meets both criteria.
10. Respondent 72972: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 45,000.0. Does not meet the compensation criteria.
11. Respondent 393: `MainBranch` is A, `CompTotal` is 49,000.0. Does not meet the compensation criteria.

Counting the respondents who meet both criteria: 73053, 300, 72859, 73195, 72749, 29150.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are 'C' and whose yearly compensation is over 100000.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for their employment status (question 2, 'C' corresponds to ""Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed"") and their total yearly compensation (question 9).

From the provided responses:

1. Respondent 219: Employment is 'C', CompTotal is 9400.0, which is less than 100000.
2. Respondent 72965: Employment is ['A', 'C'], CompTotal is 50000.0, which is less than 100000.

No other respondents have 'C' as their sole employment status or as part of their employment status with a yearly compensation over 100000.

Therefore, the count of respondents who are 'C' (Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed) and have a yearly compensation over 100000 is 0, since none meet both criteria.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents. Then, we will count how many respondents have worked with any of these languages.

1. **Identify the top 3 most desired languages:**

Looking through the responses, we compile a list of languages each respondent wants to work with and count their occurrences:

- Respondent 537: Bash/Shell;COBOL;Go;PowerShell;Python;Scala;SQL;Swift;VBA
- Respondent 72663: Kotlin
- Respondent 492: Dart;Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;Rust;Solidity;SQL;Swift;TypeScript
- Respondent 352: Bash/Shell;C;C#;C++;Go;PowerShell;Python;Rust
- Respondent 510: Bash/Shell;Go;Java;PowerShell;Scala
- Respondent 171: Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PHP;SQL;TypeScript
- Respondent 336: Go;TypeScript
- Respondent 102: C#;Go;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;SQL

Counting the occurrences of each desired language:
- Bash/Shell: 3
- COBOL: 1
- Go: 5
- PowerShell: 3
- Python: 2
- Scala: 2
- SQL: 3
- Swift: 2
- VBA: 1
- Kotlin: 1
- Dart: 1
- HTML/CSS: 3
- JavaScript: 3
- Rust: 2
- Solidity: 1
- TypeScript: 3
- C: 1
- C#: 2
- C++: 1
- Java: 1
- PHP: 1

The top 3 most desired languages are:
1. Go (5 occurrences)
2. HTML/CSS (3 occurrences), JavaScript (3 occurrences), and SQL (3 occurrences) are tied for second place. For the purpose of this task, we will consider all three as part of the top desired languages since the task does not specify how to handle ties.

2. **Count respondents who have worked with these languages:**

Now, we look at the languages each respondent has worked with and count those who have worked with Go, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or SQL:

- Respondent 537: Worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- Respondent 72663: Worked with SQL
- Respondent 492: Worked with Go, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- Respondent 352: Worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- Respondent 510: Worked with Go
- Respondent 171: Worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- Respondent 336: Worked with Go, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- Respondent 102: Worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL

Counting the respondents who have worked with at least one of these languages:
- Respondent 537 (Yes)
- Respondent 72663 (Yes)
- Respondent 492 (Yes)
- Respondent 352 (Yes)
- Respondent 510 (Yes)
- Respondent 171 (Yes)
- Respondent 336 (Yes)
- Respondent 102 (Yes)

All 8 respondents have worked with at least one of the top 3 most desired languages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total compensation (yearly) is higher than the average compensation for their country.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's compensation to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can extract the following compensations and countries:

- Respondent 73145: United States of America, 140000.0
- Respondent 192: United States of America, 200000.0
- Respondent 73057: Germany, 115000.0
- Respondent 72909: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 98000.0
- Respondent 72833: Sweden, 45000.0
- Respondent 446: United States of America, 126000.0
- Respondent 73007: Montenegro, 0.0
- Respondent 246: Netherlands, 6200.0
- Respondent 238: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 36000.0
- Respondent 113: United States of America, 70000.0

**Average Compensation by Country:**

- United States of America: (140000.0 + 200000.0 + 126000.0 + 70000.0) / 4 = 109500.0
- Germany: 115000.0 (only one respondent)
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: (98000.0 + 36000.0) / 2 = 67000.0
- Sweden: 45000.0 (only one respondent)
- Montenegro: 0.0 (only one respondent, with 0 compensation)
- Netherlands: 6200.0 (only one respondent)

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

- Respondent 73145 (USA): 140000.0 > 109500.0, Yes
- Respondent 192 (USA): 200000.0 > 109500.0, Yes
- Respondent 73057 (Germany): 115000.0 = 115000.0, No (since it's not higher, but exactly the average due to being the only respondent)
- Respondent 72909 (UK): 98000.0 > 67000.0, Yes
- Respondent 72833 (Sweden): 45000.0 = 45000.0, No (since it's not higher, but exactly the average due to being the only respondent)
- Respondent 446 (USA): 126000.0 > 109500.0, Yes
- Respondent 73007 (Montenegro): 0.0 = 0.0, No (since it's not higher, but exactly the average due to being the only respondent with 0 compensation)
- Respondent 246 (Netherlands): 6200.0 = 6200.0, No (since it's not higher, but exactly the average due to being the only respondent)
- Respondent 238 (UK): 36000.0 < 67000.0, No
- Respondent 113 (USA): 70000.0 < 109500.0, No

**Count of Respondents with Higher Than Average Compensation for Their Country:**

Based on the comparison, the respondents with higher than average compensation for their country are:

- Respondent 73145
- Respondent 192
- Respondent 72909
- Respondent 446

Therefore, the count of such respondents is 4.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCodePro refers to the years of professional coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCodePro for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 73050: YearsCodePro = 4
   - Respondent 72583: YearsCodePro = 2
   - Respondent 72893: YearsCodePro = 6
   - Respondent 73051: YearsCodePro = 6
   - Respondent 240: YearsCodePro = 7
   - Respondent 72962: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent 72899: YearsCodePro = 4
   - Respondent 72582: YearsCodePro = 6
   - Respondent 29114: YearsCodePro = 5
   Average for EdLevel A = (4 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 5) / 9 = 48 / 9 = 5.33

2. EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
   - Respondent 73136: YearsCodePro = 20
   Average for EdLevel C = 20 / 1 = 20

Since there's only one respondent for EdLevel C and none for other levels (B, D, E, F, G, H, I), we can only accurately calculate averages for EdLevel A and EdLevel C.

Now, let's identify respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level:

- For EdLevel A, the average is 5.33 years. Respondents with more experience are:
  - Respondent 240: 7 years
  - Respondent 72962: 8 years
- For EdLevel C, the average is 20 years. There is only one respondent, so there's no one to compare to.

Thus, the count of respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCodePro refers to the years of professional coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCodePro for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 48: 2 years
   - Respondent 73122: 3 years
   - Respondent 168: 1 year
   - Respondent 373: 26 years (Note: This seems like an outlier given the low education level and high years of experience, but we will include it in our calculation for accuracy.)
   - Respondent 326: 3 years
   - Respondent 73053: 2 years
   - Respondent 248: 2 years
   - Respondent 72727: 1 year
   - Respondent 73153: (Not A)
   - Respondent 72927: 13 years
   - Respondent 72796: 4 years
   Average for A = (2 + 3 + 1 + 26 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 13 + 4) / 10 = 57 / 10 = 5.7 years

2. EdLevel B (Secondary school):
   - Respondent 73153: 9 years
   Average for B = 9 years (Only one respondent)

3. EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
   - Respondent 373: 26 years
   Average for C = 26 years (Only one respondent)

4. EdLevel D (Associate degree):
   - Respondent 60: 9 years
   Average for D = 9 years (Only one respondent)

Given the data, we can now compare each respondent's YearsCodePro to the average for their EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A:
   - Respondent 48: 2 years < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 73122: 3 years < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 168: 1 year < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 373: 26 years > 5.7 years
   - Respondent 326: 3 years < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 73053: 2 years < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 248: 2 years < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 72727: 1 year < 5.7 years
   - Respondent 72927: 13 years > 5.7 years
   - Respondent 72796: 4 years < 5.7 years

2. EdLevel B:
   - Respondent 73153: 9 years = 9 years (Exactly equal, not more)

3. EdLevel C:
   - Respondent 373: Already counted in EdLevel A

4. EdLevel D:
   - Respondent 60: 9 years = 9 years (Exactly equal, not more)

Counting the respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level:
- Respondent 373
- Respondent 72927

Therefore, there are 2 respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents. Then, we will count the respondents who have worked with any of these languages.

1. **Identify the top 3 most desired languages:**

Looking through the responses, we collect all the languages mentioned in the ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" field and count their occurrences:

- HTML/CSS: 7
- JavaScript: 6
- TypeScript: 9
- Other languages appear less frequently.

Thus, the top 3 most desired languages are HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

2. **Count respondents who have worked with these languages:**

Now, we go through each respondent's ""LanguageHaveWorkedWith"" field to see if they have worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or TypeScript:

- Respondent 29056: C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 204: C#;HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;Python;SQL (Yes)
- Respondent 72981: Java;SQL (No)
- Respondent 396: Bash/Shell;Delphi;HTML/CSS;PowerShell;Python;Ruby;SQL;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 355: Bash/Shell;C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL (Yes)
- Respondent 407: Elixir;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Ruby;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 215: C++;JavaScript;Python;Rust;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 127: HTML/CSS;Rust;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 359: C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 29049: APL;Assembly;Bash/Shell;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;SQL (Yes)
- Respondent 72825: HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;PHP;SQL;TypeScript (Yes)
- Respondent 73010: HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript (Yes)

**Count of respondents who have worked with at least one of the top 3 desired languages:** 11

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more total coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's total coding experience to the average for their education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCode refers to the total years of coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCode for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 29143: YearsCode = 14
   - Respondent 155: YearsCode = 18
   - Respondent 73056: YearsCode = 26
   - Respondent 72651: YearsCode = 48
   - Respondent 72752: YearsCode = 20
   - Average for EdLevel A = (14 + 18 + 26 + 48 + 20) / 5 = 126 / 5 = 25.2

2. EdLevel B (Secondary school):
   - Respondent 204: YearsCode = 8
   - Average for EdLevel B = 8 (since there's only one respondent)

3. EdLevel A (since most respondents have this level, and there are not enough respondents in other categories to calculate a meaningful average):
   - We already calculated the average for EdLevel A as 25.2. However, this includes respondents from different educational backgrounds. For accuracy, we should only consider respondents with EdLevel A for this calculation:
   - Respondents with EdLevel A: 29143, 155, 73056, 72651, 72752, 73122, 72776, 72710, 58, 72819, 72681
   - YearsCode for these respondents: 14, 18, 26, 48, 20, 6, 9, 7, 24, 10, 20
   - Average for EdLevel A (corrected) = (14 + 18 + 26 + 48 + 20 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 24 + 10 + 20) / 11 = 202 / 11 = 18.36

Given the corrected understanding that most respondents are categorized under EdLevel A and the averages calculated, let's proceed with the comparison for EdLevel A, as it encompasses the majority of respondents and provides a broader basis for comparison:

- Respondent 29143: 14 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 155: 18 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 73056: 26 (more than 18.36)
- Respondent 72651: 48 (more than 18.36)
- Respondent 72752: 20 (more than 18.36)
- Respondent 73122: 6 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 72776: 9 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 72710: 7 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 58: 24 (more than 18.36)
- Respondent 72819: 10 (less than 18.36)
- Respondent 72681: 20 (more than 18.36)

For EdLevel B:
- Respondent 204: 8 (this is the average, so not more)

Counting the respondents with more total coding experience than the average for their education level (primarily EdLevel A, as calculated):
- Respondent 73056
- Respondent 72651
- Respondent 72752
- Respondent 58
- Respondent 72681

There are 5 respondents who have more total coding experience than the average for EdLevel A. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

Based on the provided data:

1. **Primary/elementary school (A)**: 
   - Respondent 245: 5 years
   - Respondent 398: 5 years
   - Respondent 361: 8 years
   - Average = (5 + 5 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 years

2. **Secondary school (B)**: 
   - Respondent 72913: 5 years
   - Respondent 29067: 2 years
   - Respondent 42: 10 years
   - Average = (5 + 2 + 10) / 3 = 17 / 3 = 5.67 years

3. **Some college/university study without earning a degree (C)**: 
   - Respondent 72749: 30 years
   - Average = 30 years (only one respondent)

4. **Associate degree (D)**: 
   - No respondents

5. **Bachelor's degree (E)**: 
   - No respondents

6. **Master's degree (F)**: 
   - No respondents

7. **Professional degree (G)**: 
   - No respondents

8. **Other doctoral degree (H)**: 
   - No respondents

9. **Something else (I)**: 
   - No respondents

Now, comparing each respondent's years of professional coding experience to the average for their education level:

- **Primary/elementary school (A)**: 
  - Respondent 245: 5 years (less than average)
  - Respondent 398: 5 years (less than average)
  - Respondent 361: 8 years (more than average)

- **Secondary school (B)**: 
  - Respondent 72913: 5 years (less than average)
  - Respondent 29067: 2 years (less than average)
  - Respondent 42: 10 years (more than average)

- **Some college/university study without earning a degree (C)**: 
  - Respondent 72749: 30 years (equal to average, since there's only one)

- **Associate degree (D)**, **Bachelor's degree (E)**, **Master's degree (F)**, **Professional degree (G)**, **Other doctoral degree (H)**, **Something else (I)**: No respondents to compare.

Counting the respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level:
- Respondent 361
- Respondent 42

Therefore, there are **2** respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents. Then, we will count the respondents who have worked with any of these languages.

1. **Identify the top 3 most desired languages:**

Looking through the responses, we can list the languages that each respondent wants to work with and count their occurrences:

- Rust: 2 (Respondent 291, Respondent 73262)
- HTML/CSS: 4 (Respondent 173, Respondent 72689, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72720)
- JavaScript: 4 (Respondent 173, Respondent 72689, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72720)
- Python: 4 (Respondent 173, Respondent 159, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72720)
- TypeScript: 4 (Respondent 72689, Respondent 73262, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72720)
- Other languages appear less frequently.

Thus, the top 3 most desired languages are HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python (or TypeScript, as they are tied, but for the purpose of this task, we'll consider Python as it directly competes with TypeScript in desire and is explicitly mentioned in the task context).

2. **Count respondents who have worked with these languages:**

Now, let's count the respondents who have worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or Python:

- **HTML/CSS:** Respondent 291, Respondent 72843, Respondent 72848, Respondent 173, Respondent 72689, Respondent 73262, Respondent 476, Respondent 159, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72690, Respondent 72720 (11 respondents)
- **JavaScript:** Respondent 291, Respondent 72843, Respondent 72848, Respondent 173, Respondent 72689, Respondent 73262, Respondent 476, Respondent 159, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72690, Respondent 72720 (11 respondents)
- **Python:** Respondent 291, Respondent 72843, Respondent 173, Respondent 72689, Respondent 476, Respondent 159, Respondent 73206, Respondent 72690, Respondent 72720 (9 respondents)

However, simply adding these numbers would result in double-counting respondents who have worked with more than one of these languages. Instead, we should identify unique respondents who have worked with at least one of these languages.

Looking at the responses:
- All respondents who have worked with Python have also worked with either HTML/CSS or JavaScript or both, except for none, as all who worked with Python also worked with at least one of the other two.
- Thus, we don't need to add the counts but rather ensure we're not double-counting.

Given the overlap, the unique respondents who have worked with at least one of these languages (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python) are essentially all who have worked with HTML/CSS or JavaScript, since working with Python in this dataset implies working with at least one of the other two.

Therefore, the count of unique respondents who have worked with at least one of the top 3 desired languages (considering the overlap) is the same as the count of respondents who have worked with HTML/CSS or JavaScript, which upon reviewing, includes all respondents listed for HTML/CSS and JavaScript without additional unique individuals from the Python group.

Hence, the number of respondents who have worked with at least one of the top 3 most desired languages is **11**, as this count encompasses all unique individuals who have worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or both, which indirectly includes those who have worked with Python due to the overlap in skills.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total compensation (yearly) is higher than the average compensation for their country.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's total compensation to this average, counting those whose compensation is higher.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can calculate the average compensation for each country. We'll need to group the respondents by country and sum their total compensations, then divide by the number of respondents in each country.

- **Poland:** Respondent 72994 has a CompTotal of 8000.0. Since there's only one respondent from Poland, the average is 8000.0.
- **United States of America:** Respondents 72668, 72731, 513, 72823, 492, and 369 are from the USA. Their CompTotals are 79000.0, 280000.0, 111000.0, 65000.0, 33000.0, and 90000.0, respectively. The sum is 648000.0, and there are 6 respondents, so the average is 648000.0 / 6 = 108000.0.
- **Turkey:** Respondent 61 has a CompTotal of 22000.0. Since there's only one respondent from Turkey, the average is 22000.0.
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:** Respondents 73096, 122, and 511 are from the UK. Their CompTotals are 72000.0, 104000.0, and 33000.0, respectively. The sum is 216000.0, and there are 3 respondents, so the average is 216000.0 / 3 = 72000.0.
- **Germany:** Respondent 72582 has a CompTotal of 95000.0. Since there's only one respondent from Germany, the average is 95000.0.
- **Hong Kong (S.A.R.):** Respondent 492 has a CompTotal of 33000.0. Since there's only one respondent from Hong Kong, the average is 33000.0.

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation to the Average:**

Now, we compare each respondent's total compensation to the average for their country and count those whose compensation is higher than the average.

- **Poland:** Respondent 72994's compensation (8000.0) is the average, so it's not higher.
- **United States of America:**
  - Respondent 72668's compensation (79000.0) is lower than the average (108000.0).
  - Respondent 72731's compensation (280000.0) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 513's compensation (111000.0) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 72823's compensation (65000.0) is lower than the average.
  - Respondent 492's compensation (33000.0) is lower than the average.
  - Respondent 369's compensation (90000.0) is lower than the average.
- **Turkey:** Respondent 61's compensation (22000.0) is the average, so it's not higher.
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:**
  - Respondent 73096's compensation (72000.0) is the average, so it's not higher.
  - Respondent 122's compensation (104000.0) is higher than the average.
  - Respondent 511's compensation (33000.0) is lower than the average.
- **Germany:** Respondent 72582's compensation (95000.0) is the average, so it's not higher.
- **Hong Kong (S.A.R.):** Respondent 492's compensation (33000.0) is the average, so it's not higher.

**Count of Respondents with Higher Than Average Compensation:**

From the comparisons, the respondents with total compensation higher than the average for their country are:

- Respondent 72731 (USA)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total compensation (yearly) is higher than the average compensation for their country.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's compensation to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can extract the following compensations and countries:

- Respondent 471: Colombia, 7300.0
- Respondent 72998: United States of America, 110000.0
- Respondent 159: Argentina, 81000.0
- Respondent 459: United States of America, 400000.0
- Respondent 361: United States of America, 180000.0
- Respondent 72931: Bulgaria, 11000.0
- Respondent 72837: United States of America, 140000.0
- Respondent 72815: Switzerland, 80000.0

**Compensation Frequencies:**
All compensations are given on a yearly basis as per the CompFreq question, which is not explicitly needed for calculations since all are already stated to be yearly.

**Average Compensation Calculation:**

- **Colombia:** 7300.0 / 1 = 7300.0
- **United States of America:** (110000.0 + 400000.0 + 180000.0 + 140000.0) / 4 = 230000.0
- **Argentina:** 81000.0 / 1 = 81000.0
- **Bulgaria:** 11000.0 / 1 = 11000.0
- **Switzerland:** 80000.0 / 1 = 80000.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

- Respondent 471 (Colombia): 7300.0, Average for Colombia is 7300.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 72998 (USA): 110000.0, Average for USA is 230000.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 159 (Argentina): 81000.0, Average for Argentina is 81000.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 459 (USA): 400000.0, Average for USA is 230000.0, **Higher**
- Respondent 361 (USA): 180000.0, Average for USA is 230000.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 72931 (Bulgaria): 11000.0, Average for Bulgaria is 11000.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 72837 (USA): 140000.0, Average for USA is 230000.0, **Not Higher**
- Respondent 72815 (Switzerland): 80000.0, Average for Switzerland is 80000.0, **Not Higher**

3. **Count Respondents with Higher Compensation than Average:**

From the comparisons, only Respondent 459 has a total compensation higher than the average for their country.

**Answer:** 1",True
