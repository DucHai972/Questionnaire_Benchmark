</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 5 and 15.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 5 and 15, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and look for the 'YearsCodePro' values that fall within this range.

From the data given:

- Respondent424 has 'YearsCodePro' = 2, which is not between 5 and 15.
- Respondent73147 has 'YearsCodePro' = 3, which is not between 5 and 15.
- Respondent413 has 'YearsCodePro' = 3, which is not between 5 and 15.
- Respondent72681 has 'YearsCodePro' = 15, which is exactly on the boundary and can be considered within the range depending on whether the range is inclusive or exclusive. For the purpose of this task, we'll consider it inclusive since the task does not specify otherwise.
- Respondent539 has 'YearsCodePro' = 7, which is between 5 and 15.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 5 and 15 are Respondent539 and Respondent72681.

The final answer is: Respondent539, Respondent72681",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a 'YearsCode' greater than 15?
</task>","To find the respondents with a 'YearsCode' greater than 15, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and compare their 'YearsCode' value to the threshold of 15.

After reviewing the data:

- Respondent369 has 'YearsCode' = 7, which is less than 15.
- Respondent110 has 'YearsCode' = 7, which is less than 15.
- Respondent72955 has 'YearsCode' = 10, which is less than 15.
- Respondent72831 has 'YearsCode' = 7, which is less than 15.
- Respondent297 has 'YearsCode' = 4, which is less than 15.
- Respondent395 has 'YearsCode' = 5, which is less than 15.
- Respondent471 has 'YearsCode' = 18, which is greater than 15.
- Respondent73085 has 'YearsCode' = 4, which is less than 15.
- Respondent72987 has 'YearsCode' = 17, which is greater than 15.
- Respondent127 has 'YearsCode' = 10, which is less than 15.
- Respondent73090 has 'YearsCode' = 29, which is greater than 15.
- Respondent72836 has 'YearsCode' = 17, which is greater than 15.

Therefore, the respondents with a 'YearsCode' greater than 15 are Respondent471, Respondent72987, Respondent73090, and Respondent72836.

The final answer is: $\boxed{471, 72987, 73090, 72836}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and check the value for 'pred:YearsCodePro'. We are looking for values that are greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 7.

From the provided data:

- Respondent448 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""4""'.
- Respondent73260 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""10""'.
- Respondent291 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""11""'.
- Respondent72647 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""3""'.
- Respondent72887 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""1""'.
- Respondent487 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""4""'.
- Respondent73142 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""3""'.
- Respondent73013 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""2""'.
- Respondent72683 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""7""'.
- Respondent383 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""6""'.
- Respondent73017 has 'pred:YearsCodePro ""9""'.

The respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7 are:
- Respondent448 (YearsCodePro = 4)
- Respondent72647 (YearsCodePro = 3)
- Respondent487 (YearsCodePro = 4)
- Respondent73142 (YearsCodePro = 3)
- Respondent73013 (YearsCodePro = 2)
- Respondent72683 (YearsCodePro = 7)
- Respondent383 (YearsCodePro = 6)

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7 is: 448, 72647, 487, 73142, 73013, 72683, 383.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is between 5 and 10.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is between 5 and 10, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and look for the 'YearsCode' values that fall within this range.

From the data provided:

- Respondent411 has 'YearsCode' = 18, which is not between 5 and 10.
- Respondent29113 has 'YearsCode' = 17, which is not between 5 and 10.
- Respondent72784 has 'YearsCode' = 6, which is between 5 and 10.
- Respondent72913 has 'YearsCode' = 6, which is between 5 and 10.
- Respondent29061 has 'YearsCode' = 9, which is between 5 and 10.
- Respondent269 has 'YearsCode' = 12, which is not between 5 and 10.
- Respondent72878 has 'YearsCode' = 12, which is not between 5 and 10.
- Respondent29111 has 'YearsCode' = 15, which is not between 5 and 10.
- Respondent468 has 'YearsCode' = 8, which is between 5 and 10.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'YearsCode' is between 5 and 10 are Respondent72784, Respondent72913, Respondent29061, and Respondent468.

The final answer is: Respondent72784, Respondent72913, Respondent29061, Respondent468.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

Find all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is between 118800 and 254700.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is between 118800 and 254700, we need to examine the 'CompTotal' values for each respondent in the 'responses' section.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is between 46320 and 176580.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is between 46320 and 176580, we need to examine each respondent's 'CompTotal' value in the 'responses' section.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent72731: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 5. Since 5 is not less than half of 7 (3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent72751: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 3 (1.5), this respondent meets the criteria.
3. Respondent487: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 is not less than half of 7 (3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent29157: YearsCode = 29, YearsCodePro = 20. Since 20 is not less than half of 29 (14.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent73018: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 is not less than half of 7 (3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent72730: YearsCode = 17, YearsCodePro = 12. Since 12 is not less than half of 17 (8.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent224: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 6 (3), this respondent meets the criteria.
8. Respondent72800: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 10 (5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
9. Respondent73102: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 14 (7), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
10. Respondent179: YearsCode = 20, YearsCodePro = 17. Since 17 is not less than half of 20 (10), this respondent does not meet the criteria.

The respondents that meet the criteria are Respondent72751 and Respondent224.

The final answer is: Respondent72751, Respondent224",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent413: YearsCode = 8, YearsCodePro = 3. Half of YearsCode is 4, and since 3 < 4, this respondent meets the criteria.
2. Respondent539: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 7. Half of YearsCode is 5, and since 7 ≥ 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent72913: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 5. Half of YearsCode is 3, and since 5 ≥ 3, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent72915: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 3. Half of YearsCode is 4.5, and since 3 < 4.5, this respondent meets the criteria.
5. Respondent72592: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 3. Half of YearsCode is 3.5, and since 3 < 3.5, this respondent meets the criteria.
6. Respondent72690: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 10. Half of YearsCode is 7.5, and since 10 ≥ 7.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose professional coding years are less than half their total coding years are Respondent413, Respondent72915, and Respondent72592.

The final answer is: Respondent413, Respondent72915, Respondent72592.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 135000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 135000, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data. The relevant fields for this task are 'CompTotal' (Total compensation) and 'CompFreq' (Compensation frequency).

Since 'CompFreq' indicates how often the compensation is received, we must adjust 'CompTotal' accordingly to calculate the yearly compensation. The options for 'CompFreq' are:

- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- If 'CompFreq' is A (Weekly), yearly compensation = 'CompTotal' * 52
- If 'CompFreq' is B (Monthly), yearly compensation = 'CompTotal' * 12
- If 'CompFreq' is C (Yearly), yearly compensation = 'CompTotal'

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those with a yearly compensation greater than 135000.

1. Respondent72972: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 45000.0
2. Respondent29038: CompTotal = 114000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 114000.0
3. Respondent73043: CompTotal = 145000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 145000.0
4. Respondent72752: CompTotal = 100000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 100000.0
5. Respondent162: CompTotal = 100000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 100000.0
6. Respondent222: CompTotal = 917403.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 917403.0
7. Respondent73259: CompTotal = 130000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 130000.0 * 12 = 1560000.0
8. Respondent427: CompTotal = 38000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 38000.0
9. Respondent72826: CompTotal = 135000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 135000.0
10. Respondent29115: CompTotal = 2000000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 2000000.0
11. Respondent29154: CompTotal = 320000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 320000.0

Respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 135000 are:
- Respondent222
- Respondent73259
- Respondent29115
- Respondent29154
- Respondent73043 

Note: Respondent72826 has a yearly compensation of exactly 135000, which does not meet the criteria of being greater than 135000.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The 'QCompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'QCompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the compensation frequency, we need to calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent. The calculation depends on the frequency:

- For yearly compensation (option C), the total compensation is already the yearly amount.
- For monthly compensation (option B), we multiply the total compensation by 12 to get the yearly amount.
- For weekly compensation (option A), we multiply the total compensation by 52 to get the yearly amount.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 63500.

1. Respondent223: CompTotal = 55000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 55000.0
2. Respondent73099: CompTotal = 62000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 62000.0
3. Respondent73050: CompTotal = 65000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 65000.0
4. Respondent72987: CompTotal = 57000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 57000.0
5. Respondent72730: CompTotal = 83000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 83000.0
6. Respondent72825: CompTotal = 80000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 80000.0
7. Respondent72763: CompTotal = 70000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 70000.0
8. Respondent286: CompTotal = 42000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 42000.0
9. Respondent72972: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 45000.0
10. Respondent73217: CompTotal = 288000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 288000.0 * 12 = 3456000.0 (This seems incorrect due to the high value; it might be a mistake in the interpretation. Given the context, it's more likely that 288000 is already a yearly figure or there's an error in the data. Assuming it's a yearly figure due to the context provided.)

Given the calculations and assuming Respondent73217's compensation is indeed meant to be interpreted differently or there's an error in the data:

Respondents with yearly compensation greater than 63500 are:
- Respondent73050
- Respondent72730
- Respondent72825
- Respondent72763
- Respondent73217 (with the assumption that 288000 is indeed a yearly figure or an error in data interpretation)

Therefore, the IDs of respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500 are: 73050, 72730, 72825, 72763, 73217.",False

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with half of the 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and list those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's calculate and compare these values for each respondent:

1. Respondent29096: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Half of YearsCode is 5. Since 8 is not less than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent72663: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 6. Half of YearsCode is 4.5. Since 6 is not less than 4.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent73128: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 11. Half of YearsCode is 7.5. Since 11 is not less than 7.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent73093: YearsCode = 8, YearsCodePro = 2. Half of YearsCode is 4. Since 2 is less than 4, this respondent meets the criteria.
5. Respondent139: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Half of YearsCode is 3.5. Since 4 is not less than 3.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent73051: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 6. Half of YearsCode is 3. Since 6 is not less than 3, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent219: YearsCode = 17, YearsCodePro = 14. Half of YearsCode is 8.5. Since 14 is not less than 8.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Based on the calculations, only Respondent73093 meets the criteria of having professional coding years less than half their total coding years.

The final answer is: Respondent73093",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The relevant fields from the 'questions' section are:

- `QCompTotal pred:Text ""CompTotal: Total compensation [Open-ended]""`.
- `QCompFreq pred:Text ""CompFreq: Compensation frequency [MCQ: A. Weekly B. Monthly C. Yearly]""`.

Given that `CompTotal` is open-ended and `CompFreq` indicates the frequency of compensation, we must adjust `CompTotal` based on `CompFreq` to calculate the yearly compensation.

For each respondent, if `CompFreq` is:
- A (Weekly), we multiply `CompTotal` by 52 to get the yearly compensation.
- B (Monthly), we multiply `CompTotal` by 12 to get the yearly compensation.
- C (Yearly), `CompTotal` is already the yearly compensation.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those with a yearly compensation greater than 93000.

1. Respondent255: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 98000.0, Yearly = 98000.0
2. Respondent409: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 85336.0, Yearly = 85336.0
3. Respondent268: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 130000.0, Yearly = 130000.0
4. Respondent263: CompFreq = B, CompTotal = 36000000.0, Yearly = 36000000.0 * 12 (This seems incorrect due to the large value; it might be a typo or misinterpretation. Assuming it's meant to be a yearly salary already due to its large size, we'll treat it as is for the sake of calculation.)
5. Respondent433: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 76000.0, Yearly = 76000.0
6. Respondent73148: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 124800.0, Yearly = 124800.0
7. Respondent72904: CompFreq = B, CompTotal = 4500.0, Yearly = 4500.0 * 12 = 54000.0
8. Respondent338: CompFreq = B, CompTotal = 24500.0, Yearly = 24500.0 * 12 = 294000.0
9. Respondent461: CompFreq = B, CompTotal = 2900.0, Yearly = 2900.0 * 12 = 34800.0
10. Respondent73196: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 90000.0, Yearly = 90000.0
11. Respondent73153: CompFreq = C, CompTotal = 90000.0, Yearly = 90000.0
12. Respondent72683: CompFreq = B, CompTotal = 8000.0, Yearly = 8000.0 * 12 = 96000.0

Based on the calculations:
- Respondent255: 98000.0
- Respondent268: 130000.0
- Respondent263: Assuming the provided value is already a yearly figure due to its context, 36000000.0
- Respondent73148: 124800.0
- Respondent338: 294000.0
- Respondent72683: 96000.0

These respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 93000. Therefore, the list of respondents is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent72801: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 10, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent72706: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 3. Since 3 is exactly half of 6, this respondent does not meet the criteria because we are looking for less than half.
3. Respondent185: YearsCode = 18, YearsCodePro = 9. Since 9 is half of 18, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent72663: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is more than half of 9 (4.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent72826: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 7. Since 7 is more than half of 12 (6), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent272: YearsCode = 22, YearsCodePro = 15. Since 15 is more than half of 22 (11), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent72772: YearsCode = 8, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is more than half of 8 (4), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
8. Respondent73190: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 is less than half of 15 (7.5), this respondent meets the criteria.
9. Respondent72759: YearsCode = 18, YearsCodePro = 12. Since 12 is more than half of 18 (9), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
10. Respondent255: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 3 (1.5), this respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose professional coding years are less than half their total coding years are Respondent73190 and Respondent255.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 120000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 120000, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The 'QCompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'QCompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be ""A. Weekly"", ""B. Monthly"", or ""C. Yearly"".

We will calculate the yearly compensation by multiplying the total compensation by the appropriate factor based on the compensation frequency:
- For weekly compensation, we multiply by 52.
- For monthly compensation, we multiply by 12.
- For yearly compensation, we do not need to multiply since it's already yearly.

Let's examine each respondent's data:

1. Respondent72840: CompTotal = ""39500.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 39500.0, which is less than 120000.
2. Respondent72813: CompTotal = ""150000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 150000.0, which is greater than 120000.
3. Respondent72915: CompTotal = ""85000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 85000.0, which is less than 120000.
4. Respondent73120: CompTotal = ""58000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 58000.0, which is less than 120000.
5. Respondent72789: CompTotal = ""67000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 67000.0, which is less than 120000.
6. Respondent447: CompTotal = ""200000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 200000.0, which is greater than 120000.
7. Respondent73064: CompTotal = ""134000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 134000.0, which is greater than 120000.
8. Respondent73142: CompTotal = ""36000.0"", CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly). To find the yearly compensation, we multiply by 12: 36000.0 * 12 = 432000.0, which is greater than 120000.
9. Respondent72740: CompTotal = ""120000.0"", CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly). Yearly compensation is already given, so it's 120000.0, which is not greater than 120000.

Based on the calculations, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 120000 are:
Respondent72813, Respondent447, Respondent73064, Respondent73142.

The final answer is: Respondent72813, Respondent447, Respondent73064, Respondent73142.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with half of the 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and list those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's calculate and compare these values for each respondent:

1. Respondent73047: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 5. Half of YearsCode is 5. Since 5 is equal to 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent73087: YearsCode = 43, YearsCodePro = 25. Half of YearsCode is 21.5. Since 25 is greater than 21.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent102: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 12. Half of YearsCode is 7. Since 12 is greater than 7, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent171: YearsCode = 23, YearsCodePro = 16. Half of YearsCode is 11.5. Since 16 is greater than 11.5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent123: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 2. Half of YearsCode is 4.5. Since 2 is less than 4.5, this respondent meets the criteria.
6. Respondent73196: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 4. Half of YearsCode is 5. Since 4 is less than 5, this respondent meets the criteria.
7. Respondent72826: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 7. Half of YearsCode is 6. Since 7 is greater than 6, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
8. Respondent72973: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 4. Half of YearsCode is 6. Since 4 is less than 6, this respondent meets the criteria.

The respondents that meet the criteria are Respondent123, Respondent73196, and Respondent72973. 

The final answer is: Respondent123, Respondent73196, Respondent72973.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be ""A. Weekly"", ""B. Monthly"", or ""C. Yearly"".

We will calculate the yearly compensation by multiplying the 'CompTotal' by the appropriate factor based on the 'CompFreq':

- For ""A. Weekly"", the factor is 52 (since there are 52 weeks in a year).
- For ""B. Monthly"", the factor is 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).
- For ""C. Yearly"", the factor is 1 (since the compensation is already yearly).

Let's go through the respondents and calculate their yearly compensation:

1. Respondent382: CompTotal = 120000.0, CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 120000.0 * 12 = 1440000.0
2. Respondent72834: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 45000.0 * 1 = 45000.0
3. Respondent317: CompTotal = 230000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 230000.0 * 1 = 230000.0
4. Respondent72970: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0 * 12 = 2400000.0
5. Respondent72749: CompTotal = 100000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 100000.0 * 1 = 100000.0
6. Respondent29048: CompTotal = 1566.0, CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 1566.0 * 12 = 18792.0
7. Respondent72803: CompTotal = 19000.0, CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 19000.0 * 12 = 228000.0
8. Respondent72825: CompTotal = 80000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 80000.0 * 1 = 80000.0
9. Respondent103: CompTotal = 25500.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 25500.0 * 1 = 25500.0
10. Respondent72647: CompTotal = 60000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 60000.0 * 1 = 60000.0
11. Respondent73107: CompTotal = 300000.0, CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 300000.0 * 1 = 300000.0
12. Respondent72815: CompTotal = 80000.0, CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 80000.0 * 12 = 960000.0

Now, let's identify the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000:

- Respondent382: 1440000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent317: 230000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent72970: 2400000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent72803: 228000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent73107: 300000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent72815: 960000.0 (greater than 164000)

The IDs of these respondents are: Respondent382, Respondent317, Respondent72970, Respondent72803, Respondent73107, Respondent72815.

The final answer is: Respondent382, Respondent317, Respondent72970, Respondent72803, Respondent73107, Respondent72815.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500, we first need to understand how the compensation is calculated based on the provided data. The relevant fields from the questionnaire are:

- `CompTotal`: Total compensation
- `CompFreq`: Compensation frequency [MCQ: A. Weekly B. Monthly C. Yearly]

Given this, we calculate the yearly compensation by:

- If `CompFreq` is A (Weekly), then yearly compensation = `CompTotal` * 52
- If `CompFreq` is B (Monthly), then yearly compensation = `CompTotal` * 12
- If `CompFreq` is C (Yearly), then yearly compensation = `CompTotal`

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 106500.

1. Respondent397: `CompTotal` = 6500.0, `CompFreq` = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 6500.0 * 12 = 78000.0
2. Respondent72826: `CompTotal` = 135000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 135000.0
3. Respondent73208: `CompTotal` = 3200.0, `CompFreq` = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 3200.0 * 12 = 38400.0
4. Respondent407: `CompTotal` = 155000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 155000.0
5. Respondent72594: `CompTotal` = 200000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0
6. Respondent363: `CompTotal` = 2260.0, `CompFreq` = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 2260.0 * 12 = 27120.0
7. Respondent73020: `CompTotal` = 500000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 500000.0
8. Respondent73021: `CompTotal` = 33400.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 33400.0
9. Respondent72872: `CompTotal` = 49500.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 49500.0
10. Respondent29031: `CompTotal` = 73500.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 73500.0
11. Respondent404: `CompTotal` = 180000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 180000.0
12. Respondent29124: `CompTotal` = 160000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 160000.0

From these calculations, the respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 106500 are:

- Respondent72826
- Respondent407
- Respondent72594
- Respondent73020
- Respondent404
- Respondent29124

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500 is:

Respondent72826, Respondent407, Respondent72594, Respondent73020, Respondent404, Respondent29124",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000, we need to analyze the 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq' fields in the responses.

The 'CompFreq' field indicates the frequency of compensation, with options:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation by multiplying the 'CompTotal' by the appropriate factor based on the 'CompFreq':
- For weekly compensation, multiply by 52.
- For monthly compensation, multiply by 12.
- For yearly compensation, no multiplication is needed.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent:

1. Respondent72877: CompTotal = 20000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 20000.0 * 12 = 240000.0
2. Respondent152: CompTotal = 140000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 140000.0 * 12 = 1680000.0
3. Respondent260: CompTotal = 59000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 59000.0
4. Respondent29106: CompTotal = 33000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 33000.0 * 12 = 396000.0
5. Respondent29047: CompTotal = 75000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 75000.0
6. Respondent72594: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0
7. Respondent29152: CompTotal = 70000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 70000.0
8. Respondent312: CompTotal = 120000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 120000.0 * 12 = 1440000.0

Now, let's find the respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 220000:
- Respondent152: 1680000.0
- Respondent312: 1440000.0
- Respondent72877: 240000.0

The IDs of these respondents are: Respondent72877, Respondent152, Respondent312.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The 'QCompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'QCompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the compensation frequency, we need to calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent. The calculation depends on the frequency:

- For yearly compensation (C), the total compensation is already the yearly amount.
- For monthly compensation (B), we multiply the total compensation by 12 to get the yearly amount.
- For weekly compensation (A), we multiply the total compensation by 52 to get the yearly amount.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 314000.

1. Respondent72793: CompTotal = 110000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 110000.0
2. Respondent245: CompTotal = 5500000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 5500000.0
3. Respondent423: CompTotal = 2600.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 2600.0 * 12 = 31200.0
4. Respondent73085: CompTotal = 4500000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 4500000.0 * 12 = 54000000.0
5. Respondent72913: CompTotal = 48000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 48000.0 * 12 = 576000.0
6. Respondent428: CompTotal = 11000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 11000.0
7. Respondent72931: CompTotal = 11000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 11000.0 * 12 = 132000.0
8. Respondent73084: CompTotal = 19000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 19000.0 * 12 = 228000.0
9. Respondent459: CompTotal = 400000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 400000.0
10. Respondent73262: CompTotal = 850000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 850000.0

Respondents with yearly compensation greater than 314000 are:
- Respondent245
- Respondent73085
- Respondent72913
- Respondent459
- Respondent73262

Therefore, the list of respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000 is: Respondent245, Respondent73085, Respondent72913, Respondent459, Respondent73262.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent224: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (6/2) = 3, this respondent qualifies.
2. Respondent72964: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (7/2) = 3.5, this respondent qualifies.
3. Respondent489: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 < (9/2) = 4.5, this respondent qualifies.
4. Respondent72681: YearsCode = 20, YearsCodePro = 15. Since 15 > (20/2) = 10, this respondent does not qualify.
5. Respondent72739: YearsCode = 16, YearsCodePro = 10. Since 10 = (16/2) = 8 (considering 10 is not less than half but exactly half when considering 16/2 = 8), this respondent does not qualify because the task specifies ""less than"" half.
6. Respondent202: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 < (14/2) = 7, this respondent qualifies.
7. Respondent428: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 > (3/2) = 1.5, this respondent does not qualify.
8. Respondent361: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 < (15/2) = 7.5, this respondent does not qualify because 8 is actually more than half of 15.
9. Respondent29154: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (6/2) = 3, this respondent qualifies.
10. Respondent215: YearsCode = 5, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (5/2) = 2.5, this respondent qualifies.
11. Respondent383: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 = (10/2) = 5, this respondent does not qualify because the task specifies ""less than"" half.

Qualifying respondents based on the given condition are: Respondent224, Respondent72964, Respondent489, Respondent202, Respondent29154, Respondent215.

The final answer is: Respondent224, Respondent72964, Respondent489, Respondent202, Respondent29154, Respondent215.",False

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, the first step is to extract the EdLevel and CompTotal (Total compensation) for each respondent. 

1. **Extract Relevant Data**:
   - Respondent364: EdLevel = D, CompTotal = 46000.0
   - Respondent242: EdLevel = C, CompTotal = 250000.0
   - Respondent189: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 100000.0
   - Respondent133: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 1680.0
   - Respondent397: EdLevel = C, CompTotal = 6500.0
   - Respondent73195: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 180000.0
   - Respondent508: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 800000.0
   - Respondent73087: EdLevel = H, CompTotal = 125000.0
   - Respondent72802: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 7200.0
   - Respondent29049: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 5000.0
   - Respondent365: EdLevel = A, CompTotal = 52000.0

2. **Calculate Average Compensation by EdLevel**:
   - EdLevel A: (100000.0 + 1680.0 + 180000.0 + 800000.0 + 7200.0 + 5000.0 + 52000.0) / 7 = 230571.43
   - EdLevel C: (250000.0 + 6500.0) / 2 = 128250.0
   - EdLevel D: 46000.0 (only one respondent)
   - EdLevel H: 125000.0 (only one respondent)

3. **Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Compensation for Their EdLevel**:
   - For EdLevel A, double the average is 461142.86. Respondents with compensation above this threshold: Respondent508 (800000.0)
   - For EdLevel C, double the average is 256500.0. Respondents with compensation above this threshold: Respondent242 (250000.0) does not exceed double the average.
   - For EdLevel D and H, since there's only one respondent each, we cannot calculate an average to compare against.

Based on the provided data and calculations, the respondent with a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average.

1. **Calculate Average Yearly Compensation by EdLevel:**

From the provided data, we can calculate the total compensation and the number of respondents for each EdLevel. Given that the compensation frequency (CompFreq) is mostly ""C"" (Yearly), we'll assume the CompTotal values are already yearly for simplicity. 

- **EdLevel A:** 
  - Respondent73030: 1600000.0
  - Respondent440: 45000.0
  - Respondent73148: 124800.0
  - Respondent72753: 24000.0
  - Respondent72916: 110000.0
  - Respondent423: 2600.0
  - Respondent297: 33000.0
  - Respondent72965: 50000.0
  - Respondent261: 600000.0
  - Total: 1600000.0 + 45000.0 + 124800.0 + 24000.0 + 110000.0 + 2600.0 + 33000.0 + 50000.0 + 600000.0 = 2024400.0
  - Number of Respondents: 9
  - Average: 2024400.0 / 9 = 225044.44

2. **Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Compensation for Their EdLevel:**

Given the EdLevel A average is 225044.44, more than double this average would be 450088.88.

- Checking each respondent's compensation against this threshold:
  - Respondent73030: 1600000.0 (More than double)
  - Respondent440: 45000.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent73148: 124800.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent72753: 24000.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent72916: 110000.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent423: 2600.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent297: 33000.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent72965: 50000.0 (Less than double)
  - Respondent261: 600000.0 (More than double)

Thus, the respondents with a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel are:

Respondent73030, Respondent261

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'YearsCode' for each 'EdLevel'. Then, we calculate 25% of this highest value for each 'EdLevel'. Finally, we list all respondents whose 'YearsCode' falls within this 25% range for their respective 'EdLevel'.

From the provided data:

1. **EdLevel ""A""**: The highest 'YearsCode' is 48 (Respondent72651). 25% of 48 is 12. So, we are looking for 'YearsCode' between 36 and 48 (since 48 - 12 = 36).
2. **EdLevel ""C""**: The highest 'YearsCode' is 11 (Respondent73191). 25% of 11 is 2.75. So, we are looking for 'YearsCode' between 8.25 and 11.
3. **EdLevel ""D""**: The highest 'YearsCode' is 4 (Respondent529). 25% of 4 is 1. So, we are looking for 'YearsCode' between 3 and 4.

Now, let's identify the respondents that fit these criteria:

- For **EdLevel ""A""**, 'YearsCode' between 36 and 48: Respondent72651 (48) fits this criteria.
- For **EdLevel ""C""**, 'YearsCode' between 8.25 and 11: Respondent73191 (11) fits this criteria.
- For **EdLevel ""D""**, 'YearsCode' between 3 and 4: Respondent529 (4) fits this criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their 'EdLevel' are:

Respondent72651, Respondent73191, Respondent529",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average 'YearsCodePro' for their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'YearsCodePro' for each 'EdLevel'. Then, we compare each respondent's 'YearsCodePro' with the average 'YearsCodePro' for their respective 'EdLevel' and list those whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'YearsCodePro' for each 'EdLevel':

1. **EdLevel A**:
   - Respondent73217: YearsCodePro = 14
   - Respondent361: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent326: YearsCodePro = 3
   - Respondent469: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent133: YearsCodePro = 2
   - Respondent393: YearsCodePro = 11
   - Respondent72776: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent73101: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Total YearsCodePro for EdLevel A = 14 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 11 + 5 + 8 = 59
   - Number of respondents for EdLevel A = 8
   - Average YearsCodePro for EdLevel A = 59 / 8 = 7.375

2. **EdLevel B**:
   - Respondent127: YearsCodePro = 7
   - Respondent72634: YearsCodePro = 14
   - Total YearsCodePro for EdLevel B = 7 + 14 = 21
   - Number of respondents for EdLevel B = 2
   - Average YearsCodePro for EdLevel B = 21 / 2 = 10.5

3. **EdLevel C**:
   - Respondent72761: YearsCodePro = 14
   - Total YearsCodePro for EdLevel C = 14
   - Number of respondents for EdLevel C = 1
   - Average YearsCodePro for EdLevel C = 14

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average for their 'EdLevel':

- For **EdLevel A** (average = 7.375):
  - Respondent73217: 14 > 7.375
  - Respondent393: 11 > 7.375
  - Respondent361: 8 > 7.375
  - Respondent469: 8 > 7.375
  - Respondent73101: 8 > 7.375

- For **EdLevel B** (average = 10.5):
  - Respondent72634: 14 > 10.5

- For **EdLevel C** (average = 14):
  - No respondents have YearsCodePro greater than 14.

Thus, the respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average 'YearsCodePro' for their EdLevel are:
Respondent73217, Respondent393, Respondent361, Respondent469, Respondent73101, Respondent72634.

Output: Respondent73217, Respondent393, Respondent361, Respondent469, Respondent73101, Respondent72634.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'CompTotal' for each country and then identify the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of this highest value for their respective countries.

1. **Find the highest 'CompTotal' for each country:**

From the provided data, we can calculate the highest 'CompTotal' for each country by comparing the 'CompTotal' values of respondents from the same country.

- **India:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 3200000.0 (Respondent395) and 2800000.0 (Respondent486), so the highest is 3200000.0.
- **Canada:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 88000.0 (Respondent72710).
- **United States of America:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 109000.0 (Respondent52).
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 42000.0 (Respondent73069) and 15000.0 (Respondent229), so the highest is 42000.0.
- **Netherlands:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 4000.0 (Respondent203).
- **Germany:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 67000.0 (Respondent29071).
- **Lithuania:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 7300.0 (Respondent73101).
- **Czech Republic:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 120000.0 (Respondent382).
- **Israel:** The highest 'CompTotal' is 360000.0 (Respondent72927).

2. **Calculate 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' for each country:**

- **India:** 10% of 3200000.0 = 320000.0
- **Canada:** 10% of 88000.0 = 8800.0
- **United States of America:** 10% of 109000.0 = 10900.0
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:** 10% of 42000.0 = 4200.0
- **Netherlands:** 10% of 4000.0 = 400.0
- **Germany:** 10% of 67000.0 = 6700.0
- **Lithuania:** 10% of 7300.0 = 730.0
- **Czech Republic:** 10% of 120000.0 = 12000.0
- **Israel:** 10% of 360000.0 = 36000.0

3. **Identify respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country:**

- **India:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 3200000.0 - 320000.0 = 2880000.0 and 3200000.0 + 320000.0 = 3520000.0 are within the range. Respondent395 (3200000.0) and Respondent486 (2800000.0) are the relevant respondents, but only Respondent395 is exactly at the highest value, and Respondent486 is below the highest but within the 10% range of the highest value when considering the upper limit.
- **Canada:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 88000.0 - 8800.0 = 79200.0 and 88000.0 + 8800.0 = 96800.0 are within the range. Respondent72710 (88000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **United States of America:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 109000.0 - 10900.0 = 98100.0 and 109000.0 + 10900.0 = 119900.0 are within the range. Respondent52 (109000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 42000.0 - 4200.0 = 37800.0 and 42000.0 + 4200.0 = 46200.0 are within the range. Respondent73069 (42000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **Netherlands:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 4000.0 - 400.0 = 3600.0 and 4000.0 + 400.0 = 4400.0 are within the range. Respondent203 (4000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **Germany:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 67000.0 - 6700.0 = 60300.0 and 67000.0 + 6700.0 = 73700.0 are within the range. Respondent29071 (67000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **Lithuania:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 7300.0 - 730.0 = 6570.0 and 7300.0 + 730.0 = 8030.0 are within the range. Respondent73101 (7300.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **Czech Republic:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 120000.0 - 12000.0 = 108000.0 and 120000.0 + 12000.0 = 132000.0 are within the range. Respondent382 (120000.0) is the relevant respondent.
- **Israel:** Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 360000.0 - 36000.0 = 324000.0 and 360000.0 + 36000.0 = 396000.0 are within the range. Respondent72927 (360000.0) is the relevant respondent.

Given the calculations and comparisons, the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country are:

Respondent395, Respondent486, Respondent72710, Respondent52, Respondent73069, Respondent203, Respondent29071, Respondent73101, Respondent382, Respondent72927.

Therefore, the list of respondents is: Respondent395, Respondent486, Respondent72710, Respondent52, Respondent73069, Respondent203, Respondent29071, Respondent73101, Respondent382, Respondent72927.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to this average to find those with higher compensation.

From the provided data, we can extract the following information:

1. Education Level (EdLevel)
2. Yearly Compensation (CompTotal)

Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Group Respondents by Education Level**: Group all respondents based on their education level.
2. **Calculate Average Yearly Compensation for Each Group**: For each education level group, calculate the average yearly compensation.
3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Compensation**: For each group, identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is higher than the group's average.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculation, let's analyze the data provided:

- **Respondent486**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""2800000.0""
- **Respondent123**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""12000.0""
- **Respondent547**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""300000000.0""
- **Respondent134**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""7200.0""
- **Respondent72746**: EdLevel ""C"", CompTotal ""439000.0""
- **Respondent72739**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""180000.0""
- **Respondent300**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""1000000.0""
- **Respondent479**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""12000.0""
- **Respondent72731**: EdLevel ""B"", CompTotal ""280000.0""
- **Respondent396**: EdLevel ""B"", CompTotal ""100000.0""
- **Respondent162**: EdLevel ""A"", CompTotal ""100000.0""

**Education Level A**:
- Respondent486: 2800000.0
- Respondent123: 12000.0
- Respondent547: 300000000.0
- Respondent134: 7200.0
- Respondent72739: 180000.0
- Respondent300: 1000000.0
- Respondent479: 12000.0
- Respondent162: 100000.0

Average for EdLevel A = (2800000.0 + 12000.0 + 300000000.0 + 7200.0 + 180000.0 + 1000000.0 + 12000.0 + 100000.0) / 8

Average for EdLevel A = (300280200.0 + 12000.0 + 7200.0 + 180000.0 + 1000000.0 + 12000.0 + 100000.0) / 8
= (300280200.0 + 208200.0) / 8
= 300488400.0 / 8
= 37561050.0

**Education Level B**:
- Respondent72731: 280000.0
- Respondent396: 100000.0

Average for EdLevel B = (280000.0 + 100000.0) / 2 = 380000.0 / 2 = 190000.0

**Education Level C**:
- Respondent72746: 439000.0

Since there's only one respondent in EdLevel C, the average is 439000.0.

Now, comparing each respondent's compensation to their respective group's average:

- **EdLevel A**:
  - Respondent486: 2800000.0 > 37561050.0 (No, because it's actually less when considering the correct calculation of the average)
  - Respondent123: 12000.0 < 37561050.0
  - Respondent547: 300000000.0 > 37561050.0
  - Respondent134: 7200.0 < 37561050.0
  - Respondent72739: 180000.0 < 37561050.0
  - Respondent300: 1000000.0 < 37561050.0
  - Respondent479: 12000.0 < 37561050.0
  - Respondent162: 100000.0 < 37561050.0

- **EdLevel B**:
  - Respondent72731: 280000.0 > 190000.0
  - Respondent396: 100000.0 < 190000.0

- **EdLevel C**:
  - Since there's only one respondent, there's no average to compare against in the traditional sense, but for the sake of the task, Respondent72746's compensation is the average.

Respondents with higher than average compensation for their education level are:
- Respondent547 (EdLevel A)
- Respondent72731 (EdLevel B)

Therefore, the respondents with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their respective education levels are **Respondent547, Respondent72731**.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Average Yearly Compensation by EdLevel**:
   - For each EdLevel, sum up the CompTotal values and divide by the number of respondents in that EdLevel.

2. **Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Compensation**:
   - For each respondent, calculate if their CompTotal is more than double the average CompTotal for their EdLevel.
   - List the IDs of respondents who meet this condition.

Let's start by categorizing respondents by EdLevel and calculating the average CompTotal for each:

- **EdLevel A**:
  - Respondent72664: 150000.0
  - Respondent29115: 2000000.0
  - Respondent72969: 147000.0
  - Respondent72728: 200000.0
  - Respondent392: 60000.0
  - Respondent73047: 90000.0
  - Respondent72813: 150000.0
  - Respondent72867: 8000.0
  - Respondent223: 55000.0
- **EdLevel C**:
  - Respondent72799: 90000.0
  - Respondent211: 207000.0

**Calculating Average CompTotal for EdLevel A**:
Total CompTotal for EdLevel A = 150000.0 + 2000000.0 + 147000.0 + 200000.0 + 60000.0 + 90000.0 + 150000.0 + 8000.0 + 55000.0 = 2394000.0
Number of respondents in EdLevel A = 9
Average CompTotal for EdLevel A = 2394000.0 / 9 ≈ 266000.0

**Calculating Average CompTotal for EdLevel C**:
Total CompTotal for EdLevel C = 90000.0 + 207000.0
Number of respondents in EdLevel C = 2
Average CompTotal for EdLevel C = 297000.0 / 2 = 148500.0

Now, let's identify respondents whose CompTotal is more than double the average for their EdLevel:

- For **EdLevel A**, more than double the average is > 2 * 266000.0 = 532000.0
  - Respondent29115: 2000000.0 (Meets the condition)
- For **EdLevel C**, more than double the average is > 2 * 148500.0 = 297000.0
  - Respondent211: 207000.0 (Meets the condition)

Therefore, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their respective education level to find those who have a higher compensation.

Given the data, the education levels and corresponding yearly compensations are as follows:

- EdLevel ""A"" (Primary/elementary school):
  - Respondent492: 33000.0
  - Respondent73010: 3200.0
  - Respondent72735: 73000.0
  - Respondent73150: 350000.0
  - Respondent486: 2800000.0
  - Respondent72958: 44000.0

- EdLevel ""D"" (Associate degree):
  - Respondent529: 60000.0

- EdLevel ""C"" (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
  - Respondent448: 10000000.0

First, calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level:

- For EdLevel ""A"":
  Average = (33000.0 + 3200.0 + 73000.0 + 350000.0 + 2800000.0 + 44000.0) / 6
  Average = (33000 + 3200 + 73000 + 350000 + 2800000 + 44000) / 6
  Average = 3134200 / 6
  Average = 522366.67

- For EdLevel ""D"":
  Since there's only one respondent, the average is 60000.0.

- For EdLevel ""C"":
  Since there's only one respondent, the average is 10000000.0.

Now, compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level:

- EdLevel ""A"":
  - Respondent492: 33000.0 (lower than average)
  - Respondent73010: 3200.0 (lower than average)
  - Respondent72735: 73000.0 (lower than average)
  - Respondent73150: 350000.0 (lower than average)
  - Respondent486: 2800000.0 (higher than average)
  - Respondent72958: 44000.0 (lower than average)

- EdLevel ""D"":
  - Respondent529: 60000.0 (equal to average, not higher)

- EdLevel ""C"":
  - Respondent448: 10000000.0 (equal to average, not higher)

Based on the comparison, the only respondent with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level is:

Respondent486

Therefore, the answer is:
486",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their respective education level to find those who have a higher compensation.

Given the data, the education levels and their corresponding yearly compensations are as follows:

- EdLevel ""A"" (Primary/elementary school):
  - Respondent72784: 80000.0
  - Respondent72669: 67000.0
  - Respondent123: 12000.0
  - Respondent113: 70000.0
- EdLevel ""B"" (Secondary school):
  - Respondent238: 36000.0
- EdLevel ""C"" (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
  - Respondent306: 55000.0
  - Respondent72659: 21000.0
- EdLevel ""D"" (Associate degree):
  - Respondent115: 150000.0

First, calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level:

- EdLevel ""A"": (80000.0 + 67000.0 + 12000.0 + 70000.0) / 4 = 32250.0 * 4 / 4 = 32250.0 is incorrect, the correct calculation is (80000 + 67000 + 12000 + 70000) = 229000, 229000 / 4 = 57250.0
- EdLevel ""B"": 36000.0 (only one respondent)
- EdLevel ""C"": (55000.0 + 21000.0) / 2 = 38000.0
- EdLevel ""D"": 150000.0 (only one respondent)

Now, compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level:

- EdLevel ""A"":
  - Respondent72784: 80000.0 > 57250.0
  - Respondent72669: 67000.0 > 57250.0
  - Respondent123: 12000.0 < 57250.0
  - Respondent113: 70000.0 > 57250.0
- EdLevel ""B"":
  - Respondent238: Since there's only one respondent in this category, there's no average to compare against besides their own value, which doesn't fit the criteria of being higher than an average of others in the same category.
- EdLevel ""C"":
  - Respondent306: 55000.0 > 38000.0
  - Respondent72659: 21000.0 < 38000.0
- EdLevel ""D"":
  - Respondent115: Since there's only one respondent in this category, there's no average to compare against besides their own value, which doesn't fit the criteria of being higher than an average of others in the same category.

Thus, the respondents with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level are:

Respondent72784, Respondent72669, Respondent113, Respondent306

These IDs should be listed as per the output format instructions.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Yearly Compensation**: For each respondent, we need to calculate their total yearly compensation. This can be done by multiplying their `CompTotal` by the appropriate factor based on `CompFreq`. If `CompFreq` is ""B"" (Monthly), we multiply by 12. If `CompFreq` is ""C"" (Yearly), we don't need to adjust the value. If `CompFreq` is ""A"" (Weekly), we would multiply by 52, but there are no instances of this in the provided data.

2. **Group by EdLevel and Calculate Average Yearly Compensation**: We group the respondents by their `EdLevel` and calculate the average yearly compensation for each group.

3. **Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Compensation**: For each respondent, we check if their calculated yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Yearly Compensation

- Respondent73018: 53000.0 * 12 = 636000.0
- Respondent72584: 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
- Respondent72683: 8000.0 * 12 = 96000.0
- Respondent29141: 650000.0 * 12 = 7800000.0
- Respondent248: 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
- Respondent72793: 110000.0 (since CompFreq is ""C"", no adjustment needed) = 110000.0
- Respondent73113: 4600.0 * 12 = 55200.0
- Respondent72681: 70000.0 (since CompFreq is ""C"", no adjustment needed) = 70000.0
- Respondent240: 115000.0 (since CompFreq is ""C"", no adjustment needed) = 115000.0
- Respondent440: 45000.0 * 12 = 540000.0

### Step 2: Group by EdLevel and Calculate Average Yearly Compensation

All respondents have `EdLevel` ""A"", so we calculate the average for this group:

Average = (636000.0 + 336000.0 + 96000.0 + 7800000.0 + 336000.0 + 110000.0 + 55200.0 + 70000.0 + 115000.0 + 540000.0) / 10

Average = 10271000.0 / 10 = 1027100.0

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Compensation

More than double the average = 2 * 1027100.0 = 2054200.0

Checking each respondent's yearly compensation against this threshold:

- Respondent73018: 636000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent72584: 336000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent72683: 96000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent29141: 7800000.0 (more than 2054200.0)
- Respondent248: 336000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent72793: 110000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent73113: 55200.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent72681: 70000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent240: 115000.0 (less than 2054200.0)
- Respondent440: 540000.0 (less than 2054200.0)

Only Respondent29141 has a yearly compensation more than double the average for their EdLevel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29141}$",False
