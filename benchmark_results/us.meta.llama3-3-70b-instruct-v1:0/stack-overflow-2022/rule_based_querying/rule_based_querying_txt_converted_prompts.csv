</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is between 2 and 7, we need to examine each respondent's data for the 'YearsCodePro' field and identify those that fall within this range.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 448: YearsCodePro = 4 (within range)
- Respondent 73260: YearsCodePro = 10 (outside range)
- Respondent 291: YearsCodePro = 11 (outside range)
- Respondent 72647: YearsCodePro = 3 (outside range, but very close)
- Respondent 72887: YearsCodePro = 1 (outside range)
- Respondent 487: YearsCodePro = 4 (within range)
- Respondent 73142: YearsCodePro = 3 (outside range)

- Respondent 72683: YearsCodePro = 7 (within range)
- Respondent 383: YearsCodePro = 6 (within range)
- Respondent 73017: YearsCodePro = 9 (within range)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent 72731: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 5. Since 5 is not less than half of 7 (half of 7 is 3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 72751: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 3 (half of 3 is 1.5), this respondent meets the criteria.
3. Respondent 487: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 is not less than half of 7 (half of 7 is 3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 29157: YearsCode = 29, YearsCodePro = 20. Since 20 is not less than half of 29 (half of 29 is 14.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent 73018: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 is not less than half of 7 (half of 7 is 3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent 72730: YearsCode = 17, YearsCodePro = 12. Since 12 is not less than half of 17 (half of 17 is 8.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent 224: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 6 (half of 6 is 3), this respondent meets the criteria.
8. Respondent 72800: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 10 (half of 10 is 5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
9. Respondent 73102: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 14 (half of 14 is 7), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
10. Respondent 179: YearsCode = 20, YearsCodePro = 17. Since 17 is not less than half of 20 (half of 20 is 10), this respondent does not meet the criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 135000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 135000, we need to analyze the 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq' fields for each respondent.

The 'CompFreq' field indicates the frequency of compensation, with options A (Weekly), B (Monthly), and C (Yearly). We will use this information to calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent.

Here are the calculations:

- Respondent 72972: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 45000.0

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500, we first need to understand how the compensation is calculated based on the provided data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the compensation frequencies:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- For weekly compensation: `CompTotal` * 52
- For monthly compensation: `CompTotal` * 12
- For yearly compensation: `CompTotal`

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 63500.

Respondent 223: 
  CompTotal: 55000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 55000.0

Respondent 73099: 
  CompTotal: 62000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 62000.0

Respondent 73050: 
  CompTotal: 65000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 65000.0

Respondent 72987: 
  CompTotal: 57000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 57000.0

Respondent 72730: 
  CompTotal: 83000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 83000.0

Respondent 72825: 
  CompTotal: 80000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 80000.0

Respondent 72763: 
  CompTotal: 70000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 70000.0

Respondent 286: 
  CompTotal: 42000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 42000.0

Respondent 72972: 
  CompTotal: 45000.0
  CompFreq: C (Yearly)
  Yearly Compensation: 45000.0

Respondent 73217: 
  CompTotal: 288000.0
  CompFreq: B (Monthly)
  Yearly Compensation: 288000.0 * 12 = 3456000.0

Based on the calculations, the respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 63500 are:
73050, 72730, 72825, 73217

These respondents have yearly compensations of 65000.0, 83000.0, 80000.0, and 3456000.0 respectively, all of which are greater than 63500.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent 29096: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 10, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 72663: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is not less than half of 9 (4.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent 73128: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 11. Since 11 is not less than half of 15 (7.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 73093: YearsCode = 8, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 is less than half of 8 (4), this respondent meets the criteria.
5. Respondent 139: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 is not less than half of 7 (3.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent 73051: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is not less than half of 6 (3), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent 219: YearsCode = 17, YearsCodePro = 14. Since 14 is not less than half of 17 (8.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Only Respondent 73093 meets the condition where their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000, we first need to understand how the compensation is calculated based on the provided data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field indicates the frequency of this compensation, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the 'CompFreq' options:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- If 'CompFreq' is A (Weekly), the yearly compensation is 'CompTotal' * 52.
- If 'CompFreq' is B (Monthly), the yearly compensation is 'CompTotal' * 12.
- If 'CompFreq' is C (Yearly), the yearly compensation is 'CompTotal'.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 93000.

1. Respondent 255: CompTotal = 98000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 98000.0.
2. Respondent 409: CompTotal = 85336.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 85336.0.
3. Respondent 268: CompTotal = 130000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 130000.0.
4. Respondent 263: CompTotal = 36000000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 36000000.0 * 12.
5. Respondent 433: CompTotal = 76000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 76000.0.
6. Respondent 73148: CompTotal = 124800.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 124800.0.
7. Respondent 72904: CompTotal = 4500.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 4500.0 * 12.
8. Respondent 338: CompTotal = 24500.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 24500.0 * 12.
9. Respondent 461: CompTotal = 2900.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 2900.0 * 12.
10. Respondent 73196: CompTotal = 90000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 90000.0.
11. Respondent 73153: CompTotal = 90000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 90000.0.
12. Respondent 72683: CompTotal = 8000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 8000.0 * 12.

Calculating the specific values:
- Respondent 263's yearly compensation = 36000000.0 * 12 = 432000000.0, which is greater than 93000.
- Respondent 72904's yearly compensation = 4500.0 * 12 = 54000.0, which is less than 93000.
- Respondent 338's yearly compensation = 24500.0 * 12 = 294000.0, which is greater than 93000.
- Respondent 461's yearly compensation = 2900.0 * 12 = 34800.0, which is less than 93000.
- Respondent 72683's yearly compensation = 8000.0 * 12 = 96000.0, which is greater than 93000.

Based on the direct calculations provided in the question context:
- Respondents 255, 268, 73148, 73196, and 73153 have yearly compensations of 98000.0, 130000.0, 124800.0, 90000.0, and 90000.0 respectively. Among these, 255, 268, and 73148 have compensations greater than 93000.
- Additionally, Respondent 263 and 338, and 72683 have yearly compensations greater than 93000 based on the frequency adjustments.

Therefore, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000 are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent 72801: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 is not less than half of 10, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 72706: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 3. Since 3 is exactly half of 6, this respondent does not meet the criteria because we are looking for less than half.
3. Respondent 185: YearsCode = 18, YearsCodePro = 9. Since 9 is half of 18, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 72663: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is more than half of 9 (4.5), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent 72826: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 7. Since 7 is more than half of 12 (6), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent 272: YearsCode = 22, YearsCodePro = 15. Since 15 is more than half of 22 (11), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent 72772: YearsCode = 8, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 is more than half of 8 (4), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
8. Respondent 73190: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 is less than half of 15 (7.5), this respondent meets the criteria.
9. Respondent 72759: YearsCode = 18, YearsCodePro = 12. Since 12 is more than half of 18 (9), this respondent does not meet the criteria.
10. Respondent 255: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 is less than half of 3 (1.5), this respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years are 73190, 255.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 120000.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 120000, we first need to understand how the compensation is calculated based on the provided data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the compensation frequencies:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- For weekly compensation, we multiply by 52.
- For monthly compensation, we multiply by 12.
- For yearly compensation, the value remains the same.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those with a yearly compensation greater than 120000.

1. Respondent 72840: CompTotal = 39500.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 39500.0
2. Respondent 72813: CompTotal = 150000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 150000.0
3. Respondent 72915: CompTotal = 85000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 85000.0
4. Respondent 73120: CompTotal = 58000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 58000.0
5. Respondent 72789: CompTotal = 67000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 67000.0
6. Respondent 447: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0
7. Respondent 73064: CompTotal = 134000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 134000.0
8. Respondent 73142: CompTotal = 36000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 36000.0 * 12 = 432000.0
9. Respondent 72740: CompTotal = 120000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 120000.0

Based on the calculations, the respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 120000 are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent 73047: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 5. Since 5 is half of 10, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 73087: YearsCode = 43, YearsCodePro = 25. Half of 43 is 21.5, and 25 is more than half, so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent 102: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 12. Half of 14 is 7, and 12 is more than half, so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 171: YearsCode = 23, YearsCodePro = 16. Half of 23 is 11.5, and 16 is more than half, so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent 123: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 2. Half of 9 is 4.5, and 2 is less than half, so this respondent meets the criteria.
6. Respondent 73196: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 4. Half of 10 is 5, and 4 is less than half, so this respondent meets the criteria.
7. Respondent 72826: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 7. Half of 12 is 6, and 7 is more than half, so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
8. Respondent 72973: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 4. Half of 12 is 6, and 4 is less than half, so this respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years are: 123, 73196, 72973.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000.
</task>","To find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000, we need to analyze the 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq' fields for each respondent.

The 'CompFreq' field indicates the frequency of compensation, with the following options:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent based on their 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq'. If 'CompFreq' is:
- A. Weekly, we multiply 'CompTotal' by 52.
- B. Monthly, we multiply 'CompTotal' by 12.
- C. Yearly, 'CompTotal' is already the yearly compensation.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent:

Respondent 382: CompTotal = 120000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 120000.0 * 12 = 1440000.0
Respondent 72834: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 45000.0
Respondent 317: CompTotal = 230000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 230000.0
Respondent 72970: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0 * 12 = 2400000.0
Respondent 72749: CompTotal = 100000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 100000.0
Respondent 29048: CompTotal = 1566.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 1566.0 * 12 = 18792.0
Respondent 72803: CompTotal = 19000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 19000.0 * 12 = 228000.0
Respondent 72825: CompTotal = 80000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 80000.0
Respondent 103: CompTotal = 25500.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 25500.0
Respondent 72647: CompTotal = 60000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 60000.0
Respondent 73107: CompTotal = 300000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 300000.0
Respondent 72815: CompTotal = 80000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 80000.0 * 12 = 960000.0

Now, let's identify the respondents with a yearly compensation greater than 164000:
- Respondent 382: 1440000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent 72970: 2400000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent 317: 230000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent 72803: 228000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent 73107: 300000.0 (greater than 164000)
- Respondent 72815: 960000.0 (greater than 164000)

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500, we first need to understand how the compensation is calculated based on the provided data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field indicates the frequency of this compensation, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the 'CompFreq' options:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- For weekly compensation, we multiply 'CompTotal' by 52.
- For monthly compensation, we multiply 'CompTotal' by 12.
- For yearly compensation, 'CompTotal' is already the yearly amount.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation exceeds 106500.

1. Respondent 397: CompTotal = 6500.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), Yearly Compensation = 6500.0 * 12 = 78000.0
2. Respondent 72826: CompTotal = 135000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 135000.0
3. Respondent 73208: CompTotal = 3200.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), Yearly Compensation = 3200.0 * 12 = 38400.0
4. Respondent 407: CompTotal = 155000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 155000.0
5. Respondent 72594: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 200000.0
6. Respondent 363: CompTotal = 2260.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), Yearly Compensation = 2260.0 * 12 = 27120.0
7. Respondent 73020: CompTotal = 500000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 500000.0
8. Respondent 73021: CompTotal = 33400.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 33400.0
9. Respondent 72872: CompTotal = 49500.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 49500.0
10. Respondent 29031: CompTotal = 73500.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 73500.0
11. Respondent 404: CompTotal = 180000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 180000.0
12. Respondent 29124: CompTotal = 160000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), Yearly Compensation = 160000.0

Respondents with yearly compensation greater than 106500:
- Respondent 72826: 135000.0
- Respondent 407: 155000.0
- Respondent 72594: 200000.0
- Respondent 73020: 500000.0
- Respondent 404: 180000.0
- Respondent 29124: 160000.0

Therefore, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500 are: 72826, 407, 72594, 73020, 404, 29124.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000, we first need to understand how the compensation is represented in the data. The 'CompTotal' field represents the total compensation, and the 'CompFreq' field represents the compensation frequency, which can be weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Given the compensation frequency, we can calculate the yearly compensation as follows:
- For weekly compensation, multiply 'CompTotal' by 52.
- For monthly compensation, multiply 'CompTotal' by 12.
- For yearly compensation, 'CompTotal' is already the yearly compensation.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those whose yearly compensation is greater than 220000.

1. Respondent 72877: CompTotal = 20000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 20000.0 * 12 = 240000.0
2. Respondent 152: CompTotal = 140000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 140000.0 * 12 = 1680000.0
3. Respondent 260: CompTotal = 59000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 59000.0
4. Respondent 29106: CompTotal = 33000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly), so yearly compensation = 33000.0 * 12 = 396000.0
5. Respondent 29047: CompTotal = 75000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 75000.0
6. Respondent 72594: CompTotal = 200000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly), so yearly compensation = 200000.0

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000, we need to analyze the 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq' fields for each respondent.

'CompFreq' indicates the frequency of compensation, with the options:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent based on their 'CompTotal' and 'CompFreq'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents for whom their professional coding years are less than half their total coding years.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'YearsCodePro' (years of professional coding experience) with 'YearsCode' (total years of coding experience) for each respondent and identify those where 'YearsCodePro' is less than half of 'YearsCode'.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Respondent 224: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (6 / 2) = 3, this respondent qualifies.
2. Respondent 72964: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (7 / 2) = 3.5, this respondent qualifies.
3. Respondent 489: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 < (9 / 2) = 4.5, this respondent qualifies.
4. Respondent 72681: YearsCode = 20, YearsCodePro = 15. Since 15 >= (20 / 2) = 10, this respondent does not qualify.
5. Respondent 72739: YearsCode = 16, YearsCodePro = 10. Since 10 >= (16 / 2) = 8, this respondent does not qualify.
6. Respondent 202: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 2. Since 2 < (14 / 2) = 7, this respondent qualifies.
7. Respondent 428: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = 4. Since 4 >= (3 / 2) = 1.5, this respondent does not qualify.
8. Respondent 361: YearsCode = 15, YearsCodePro = 8. Since 8 >= (15 / 2) = 7.5, this respondent does not qualify.
9. Respondent 29154: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (6 / 2) = 3, this respondent qualifies.
10. Respondent 215: YearsCode = 5, YearsCodePro = 1. Since 1 < (5 / 2) = 2.5, this respondent qualifies.
11. Respondent 383: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 6. Since 6 >= (10 / 2) = 5, this respondent does not qualify.

The respondents that meet the criteria are: 224, 72964, 489, 202, 29154, 215. 

The final answer is: 224, 72964, 489, 202, 29154, 215.",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total yearly compensation for each respondent. Since CompFreq (Compensation frequency) is given, we need to adjust CompTotal (Total compensation) accordingly. For simplicity, let's assume:
   - Weekly (A) means 52 weeks of compensation.
   - Monthly (B) means 12 months of compensation.
   - Yearly (C) means 1 year of compensation.

2. Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.

3. Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.

Let's start by calculating the total yearly compensation for each respondent and then proceed with the averages and comparisons.

### Calculating Yearly Compensation

- Respondent 364: 46000.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 46000.0 * 12 = 552000.0
- Respondent 242: 250000.0 (Yearly), so yearly is 250000.0
- Respondent 189: 100000.0 (Yearly), so yearly is 100000.0
- Respondent 133: 1680.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 1680.0 * 12 = 20160.0
- Respondent 397: 6500.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 6500.0 * 12 = 78000.0
- Respondent 73195: 180000.0 (Yearly), so yearly is 180000.0
- Respondent 508: 800000.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 800000.0 * 12 = 9600000.0
- Respondent 73087: 125000.0 (Yearly), so yearly is 125000.0
- Respondent 72802: 7200.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 7200.0 * 12 = 86400.0
- Respondent 29049: 5000.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 5000.0 * 12 = 60000.0
- Respondent 365: 52000.0 (Monthly), so yearly is 52000.0 * 12 = 624000.0

### EdLevel and Yearly Compensation

- A (Primary/elementary school): 
  - Respondent 189: 100000.0
  - Respondent 133: 20160.0
  - Respondent 508: 9600000.0
  - Respondent 365: 624000.0
  - Respondent 72802: 86400.0
- B (Secondary school): None
- C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
  - Respondent 242: 250000.0
  - Respondent 397: 78000.0
- D (Associate degree):
  - Respondent 364: 552000.0
- E (Bachelor's degree): None
- F (Master's degree): None
- G (Professional degree): None
- H (Other doctoral degree): 
  - Respondent 73087: 125000.0
- I (Something else):
  - Respondent 29049: 60000.0

### Calculating Averages

- A: (100000.0 + 20160.0 + 9600000.0 + 624000.0 + 86400.0) / 5 = (100000.0 + 20160.0 + 9600000.0 + 624000.0 + 86400.0) / 5 = 1072320.0
- C: (250000.0 + 78000.0) / 2 = 328000.0
- D: 552000.0 (Only one respondent)
- H: 125000.0 (Only one respondent)
- I: 60000.0 (Only one respondent)

### Identifying Respondents

- For EdLevel A, average is 1072320.0. More than double is 2144640.0. Respondent 508 (9600000.0) qualifies.
- For EdLevel C, average is 328000.0. More than double is 656000.0. Respondent 242 (250000.0) does not qualify.
- For EdLevel D, average is 552000.0. More than double is 1104000.0. No one qualifies since there's only one respondent.
- For EdLevel H, average is 125000.0. More than double is 250000.0. No one qualifies since there's only one respondent.
- For EdLevel I, average is 60000.0. More than double is 120000.0. No one qualifies since there's only one respondent.

Given the calculations and comparisons, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we can start by calculating the total compensation and the number of respondents for each EdLevel to find the average compensation per EdLevel.

### EdLevel A:
- Respondent 73030: CompTotal = 1600000.0
- Respondent 440: CompTotal = 45000.0
- Respondent 73148: CompTotal = 124800.0
- Respondent 72753: CompTotal = 24000.0
- Respondent 72916: CompTotal = 110000.0
- Respondent 423: CompTotal = 2600.0 (CompFreq = B, so this is monthly, and we need to convert it to yearly: 2600 * 12 = 31200.0)
- Respondent 297: CompTotal = 33000.0 (CompFreq = B, so this is monthly, and we need to convert it to yearly: 33000 * 12 = 396000.0)
- Respondent 72965: CompTotal = 50000.0
- Respondent 261: CompTotal = 600000.0

Total CompTotal for EdLevel A = 1600000.0 + 45000.0 + 124800.0 + 24000.0 + 110000.0 + 31200.0 + 396000.0 + 50000.0 + 600000.0 = 2830500.0

Number of respondents for EdLevel A = 9

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel A = Total CompTotal for EdLevel A / Number of respondents for EdLevel A = 2830500.0 / 9 ≈ 314722.22

More than double the average for EdLevel A = 2 * 314722.22 ≈ 629444.44

### Checking Respondents for EdLevel A:
- Respondent 73030: 1600000.0 > 629444.44
- Respondent 261: 600000.0 > 629444.44 (No)
- Respondent 297: 396000.0 > 629444.44 (No)
- Other respondents have compensation less than 629444.44.

Only Respondent 73030 has a compensation more than double the average for EdLevel A.

Since all respondents are listed under EdLevel A, and we've identified the one whose compensation exceeds double the average for their EdLevel, we don't need to calculate for other EdLevels as there are no respondents in other categories provided in the data.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73030}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'YearsCode' for each 'EdLevel', and then identify the respondents whose 'YearsCode' falls within 25% of this highest value for their respective 'EdLevel'.

Given the data, let's first categorize the respondents by 'EdLevel' and find the maximum 'YearsCode' for each 'EdLevel':

1. **EdLevel: A (Primary/elementary school)**
   - Respondent 72681: YearsCode = 20
   - Respondent 29157: YearsCode = 29
   - Respondent 72651: YearsCode = 48
   - Respondent 73100: YearsCode = 10
   - Respondent 412: YearsCode = 11
   - Respondent 72647: YearsCode = 5
   - Respondent 63: YearsCode = 30
   - Respondent 184: YearsCode = 2
   - Respondent 72664: YearsCode = 25
   - Maximum YearsCode for EdLevel A = 48 (Respondent 72651)

2. **EdLevel: C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)**
   - Respondent 73191: YearsCode = 11
   - Maximum YearsCode for EdLevel C = 11 (Respondent 73191)

3. **EdLevel: D (Associate degree)**
   - Respondent 529: YearsCode = 4
   - Maximum YearsCode for EdLevel D = 4 (Respondent 529)

Now, let's calculate 25% of the maximum 'YearsCode' for each 'EdLevel' and identify respondents whose 'YearsCode' falls within this range:

1. **EdLevel: A**
   - 25% of 48 = 12
   - Respondents with YearsCode within 25% of 48 (between 36 and 48, since 25% below 48 is 36):
     - Respondent 72651: YearsCode = 48 (within range)
     - Respondent 63: YearsCode = 30 (not within range)
     - Respondent 72664: YearsCode = 25 (not within range)
     - Other respondents have YearsCode less than 36.

2. **EdLevel: C**
   - 25% of 11 = 2.75
   - Respondents with YearsCode within 25% of 11 (between 8.25 and 11):
     - Respondent 73191: YearsCode = 11 (within range)

3. **EdLevel: D**
   - 25% of 4 = 1
   - Respondents with YearsCode within 25% of 4 (between 3 and 4):
     - Respondent 529: YearsCode = 4 (within range)

Based on the calculations, the respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their 'EdLevel' are:

- Respondent 72651 (EdLevel A, YearsCode = 48)
- Respondent 73191 (EdLevel C, YearsCode = 11)
- Respondent 529 (EdLevel D, YearsCode = 4)

Therefore, the list of respondents is: 72651, 73191, 529",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average 'YearsCodePro' for their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'YearsCodePro' for each 'EdLevel'. Then, we compare each respondent's 'YearsCodePro' to the average for their respective 'EdLevel' and list those whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'YearsCodePro' for each 'EdLevel':

1. EdLevel A:
   - Respondent 73217: YearsCodePro = 14
   - Respondent 361: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent 326: YearsCodePro = 3
   - Respondent 469: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Respondent 133: YearsCodePro = 2
   - Respondent 393: YearsCodePro = 11
   - Respondent 72776: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent 73101: YearsCodePro = 8
   Average for EdLevel A = (14 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 11 + 5 + 8) / 8 = 59 / 8 = 7.375

2. EdLevel B:
   - Respondent 127: YearsCodePro = 7
   - Respondent 72634: YearsCodePro = 14
   Average for EdLevel B = (7 + 14) / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10.5

3. EdLevel C:
   - Respondent 72761: YearsCodePro = 14
   Average for EdLevel C = 14 (since there's only one respondent)

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average for their 'EdLevel':

1. EdLevel A (Average = 7.375):
   - Respondent 73217: 14 > 7.375
   - Respondent 393: 11 > 7.375
   - Respondent 361: 8 > 7.375
   - Respondent 469: 8 > 7.375
   - Respondent 73101: 8 > 7.375

2. EdLevel B (Average = 10.5):
   - Respondent 72634: 14 > 10.5

3. EdLevel C (Average = 14):
   - No respondents have 'YearsCodePro' greater than 14.

Thus, the respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average for their 'EdLevel' are:
73217, 393, 361, 469, 73101, 72634.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'CompTotal' for each country and then identify the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of this highest value for their respective countries.

1. **Identify the highest 'CompTotal' for each country:**

- India: Respondent 395 has a 'CompTotal' of 3200000.0, and Respondent 486 has a 'CompTotal' of 2800000.0. The highest is 3200000.0.
- Canada: Respondent 72710 has a 'CompTotal' of 88000.0.
- United States of America: Respondent 52 has a 'CompTotal' of 109000.0.
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: Respondent 73069 has a 'CompTotal' of 42000.0, and Respondent 229 has a 'CompTotal' of 15000.0. The highest is 42000.0.
- Netherlands: Respondent 203 has a 'CompTotal' of 4000.0.
- Germany: Respondent 29071 has a 'CompTotal' of 67000.0.
- Lithuania: Respondent 73101 has a 'CompTotal' of 7300.0.
- Czech Republic: Respondent 382 has a 'CompTotal' of 120000.0.
- Israel: Respondent 72927 has a 'CompTotal' of 360000.0.

2. **Calculate 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' for each country:**

- India: 10% of 3200000.0 = 320000.0
- Canada: 10% of 88000.0 = 8800.0
- United States of America: 10% of 109000.0 = 10900.0
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 10% of 42000.0 = 4200.0
- Netherlands: 10% of 4000.0 = 400.0
- Germany: 10% of 67000.0 = 6700.0
- Lithuania: 10% of 7300.0 = 730.0
- Czech Republic: 10% of 120000.0 = 12000.0
- Israel: 10% of 360000.0 = 36000.0

3. **Identify respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country:**

- India: Respondents with 'CompTotal' between 2880000.0 (3200000.0 - 320000.0) and 3520000.0 (3200000.0 + 320000.0) are within 10%. Respondent 395 (3200000.0) and Respondent 486 (2800000.0) are the closest, but only Respondent 395 exactly matches the highest, and Respondent 486 is below the 10% threshold.
- Canada: Respondent 72710 (88000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- United States of America: Respondent 52 (109000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: Respondent 73069 (42000.0) is the only one at the highest, and Respondent 229 (15000.0) is below the 10% threshold.
- Netherlands: Respondent 203 (4000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- Germany: Respondent 29071 (67000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- Lithuania: Respondent 73101 (7300.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- Czech Republic: Respondent 382 (120000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.
- Israel: Respondent 72927 (360000.0) is the only one and is exactly at the highest.

Given the task's requirements, the list includes respondents who are exactly at the highest 'CompTotal' for their country or within a 10% range of it. However, upon closer examination, it appears the primary focus is on those exactly at or very close to the highest value within their country, considering the 10% threshold as a guideline for proximity rather than a strict inclusion criterion.

Thus, the respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country, or more accurately, the ones exactly at the highest or closest to it within their respective countries, are:

395, 72710, 52, 73069, 203, 29071, 73101, 382, 72927

However, the precise interpretation of ""within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal'"" suggests we should focus on those whose compensation is between 90% and 110% of the highest compensation in their country. Given this, the initial assessment might need refinement based on exact calculations for each country:

- For India, the range is between 2880000.0 and 3520000.0, which includes Respondent 395 and potentially others not listed due to the absence of their exact 'CompTotal' values in the provided data snippet.
- For other countries, without additional respondents, the ones listed are the highest or among the highest.

Given the data and focusing strictly on the ""within 10%"" criterion, the list should technically only include those whose 'CompTotal' falls within this specific range for their country. The provided analysis aimed to identify the highest earners and those potentially within the 10% range but might not strictly adhere to the ""within 10%"" rule due to the absence of detailed 'CompTotal' values for comparison.

To strictly follow the format and provide a concise answer based on the detailed analysis and the specific question asked, and acknowledging the potential for misunderstanding in the application of the ""10% rule,"" the final list of respondents should be derived from a precise calculation of who falls within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their respective countries. However, the initial analysis suggests focusing on the highest earners as a proxy, which may not fully align with the question's intent.

Given the constraints and aiming for precision, the task requires identifying respondents with 'CompTotal' values that are between 90% and 110% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country. Without exact 'CompTotal' values for all respondents and considering the potential for respondents not listed, the answer provided below aims to reflect the closest match to the task's requirements based on the detailed analysis:

Respondent 395, Respondent 72710, Respondent 52, Respondent 73069, Respondent 203, Respondent 29071, Respondent 73101, Respondent 382, Respondent 72927

However, to adhere strictly to the format and recognizing the potential for a more precise answer with complete data, the final answer should be a comma-separated list of respondent IDs that meet the specific criterion of having a 'CompTotal' within 10% of the highest in their country, which based on the provided analysis and data, suggests a focus on the highest earners as potential candidates. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{395, 72710, 52, 73069, 203, 29071, 73101, 382, 72927}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level to find those who have a higher compensation.

Based on the provided data:

1. Calculate the total compensation and count of respondents for each education level:
   - EdLevel A: 
     - Respondent 486: 2800000.0
     - Respondent 123: 12000.0
     - Respondent 547: 300000000.0
     - Respondent 134: 7200.0
     - Respondent 72746: 439000.0
     - Respondent 72739: 180000.0
     - Respondent 300: 1000000.0
     - Respondent 479: 12000.0
     - Respondent 162: 100000.0
     - Total: 301743200.0, Count: 9
   - EdLevel B: 
     - Respondent 396: 100000.0
     - Respondent 72731: 280000.0
     - Total: 380000.0, Count: 2
   - EdLevel C: 
     - Respondent 72746: 439000.0
     - Total: 439000.0, Count: 1

2. Calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level:
   - EdLevel A: 301743200.0 / 9 = 33527133.33
   - EdLevel B: 380000.0 / 2 = 190000.0
   - EdLevel C: 439000.0 / 1 = 439000.0

3. Identify respondents with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level:
   - EdLevel A: 
     - Respondent 547: 300000000.0 (higher than 33527133.33)
     - Respondent 486: 2800000.0 (higher than 33527133.33)
   - EdLevel B: None
   - EdLevel C: None (since there's only one respondent, they are the average)

Therefore, the respondents with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level are:
Respondent 547, Respondent 486",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total yearly compensation for each respondent. Since CompFreq is mostly 'C' (Yearly), we'll assume CompTotal is already in yearly figures for simplicity.
2. Group respondents by EdLevel and calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.
3. For each respondent, check if their yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.
4. List the IDs of respondents who meet the condition.

Let's start by grouping and calculating averages:

- EdLevel A: 
  - Respondent 72664: 150000.0
  - Respondent 29115: 2000000.0
  - Respondent 72969: 147000.0
  - Respondent 72728: 200000.0
  - Respondent 392: 60000.0
  - Respondent 73047: 90000.0
  - Respondent 72813: 150000.0
  - Respondent 72867: 8000.0
  - Respondent 223: 55000.0
  Total: 2000000.0 + 150000.0 + 147000.0 + 200000.0 + 60000.0 + 90000.0 + 150000.0 + 8000.0 + 55000.0 = 2833000.0
  Count: 9
  Average: 2833000.0 / 9 = 314777.78

- EdLevel C: 
  - Respondent 72799: 90000.0
  - Respondent 211: 207000.0
  Total: 90000.0 + 207000.0 = 297000.0
  Count: 2
  Average: 297000.0 / 2 = 148500.0

Now, let's check which respondents have a yearly compensation more than double the average for their EdLevel:

- For EdLevel A, double the average is 2 * 314777.78 = 629555.56
  - Respondent 29115: 2000000.0 (Meets the condition)

- For EdLevel C, double the average is 2 * 148500.0 = 297000.0
  - Respondent 211: 207000.0 (Meets the condition)

Thus, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level to find those who have a higher compensation.

1. **Calculate Average Yearly Compensation by Education Level:**

   - **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):**
     - Respondent 492: 33000.0
     - Respondent 73010: 3200.0
     - Respondent 72735: 73000.0
     - Respondent 72958: 44000.0
     - Average = (33000.0 + 3200.0 + 73000.0 + 44000.0) / 4 = 53500.0
   - **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):**
     - Respondent 448: 10000000.0
     - Average = 10000000.0
   - **EdLevel D (Associate degree):**
     - Respondent 529: 60000.0
     - Average = 60000.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

   - **EdLevel A:**
     - Respondent 492: 33000.0 (lower than average)
     - Respondent 73010: 3200.0 (lower than average)
     - Respondent 72735: 73000.0 (higher than average)
     - Respondent 72958: 44000.0 (lower than average)
   - **EdLevel C:**
     - Respondent 448: 10000000.0 (same as average, but since it's the only one, it's not higher)
   - **EdLevel D:**
     - Respondent 529: 60000.0 (same as average, but since it's the only one, it's not higher)

3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Compensation for Their Education Level:**

   - Only Respondent 72735 has a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level.

**Answer:** 72735",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level to find those who have a higher compensation.

1. **Calculate Average Yearly Compensation by Education Level:**

   - **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):** 
     - Respondent 72784: $80,000.0
     - Respondent 72669: $67,000.0
     - Respondent 547: $300,000,000.0
     - Respondent 123: $12,000.0
     - Average = ($80,000.0 + $67,000.0 + $300,000,000.0 + $12,000.0) / 4 = $300,039,765.5
   - **EdLevel B (Secondary school):** 
     - Respondent 238: $36,000.0
     - Average = $36,000.0
   - **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):** 
     - Respondent 306: $55,000.0
     - Respondent 72659: $21,000.0
     - Average = ($55,000.0 + $21,000.0) / 2 = $38,000.0
   - **EdLevel D (Associate degree):** 
     - Respondent 115: $150,000.0
     - Average = $150,000.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

   - **EdLevel A:** 
     - Respondent 72784: $80,000.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 72669: $67,000.0 (Lower than average)
     - Respondent 547: $300,000,000.0 (Higher than average)
     - Respondent 123: $12,000.0 (Lower than average)
   - **EdLevel B:** 
     - Respondent 238: $36,000.0 (Equal to average, not higher)
   - **EdLevel C:** 
     - Respondent 306: $55,000.0 (Higher than average)
     - Respondent 72659: $21,000.0 (Lower than average)
   - **EdLevel D:** 
     - Respondent 115: $150,000.0 (Equal to average, not higher)

3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Compensation for Their Education Level:**

   - Respondent 547 (EdLevel A)
   - Respondent 306 (EdLevel C)

**Answer:** 547, 306",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel, and then identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double this average for their respective EdLevel.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total yearly compensation for each respondent. Since CompFreq (Compensation frequency) is given as Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly, we need to adjust the CompTotal (Total compensation) accordingly to get the yearly compensation.
2. Group the respondents by their EdLevel and calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.
3. For each respondent, check if their yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.
4. List the IDs of the respondents who meet the condition.

Let's start by calculating the yearly compensation for each respondent and then proceed with the grouping and comparison.

### Step 1: Calculate Yearly Compensation

- For CompFreq = A (Weekly), yearly compensation = CompTotal * 52
- For CompFreq = B (Monthly), yearly compensation = CompTotal * 12
- For CompFreq = C (Yearly), yearly compensation = CompTotal

### Calculations

1. Respondent 73018: CompTotal = 53000.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 53000.0 * 12 = 636000.0
2. Respondent 72584: CompTotal = 28000.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
3. Respondent 72683: CompTotal = 8000.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 8000.0 * 12 = 96000.0
4. Respondent 29141: CompTotal = 650000.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 650000.0 * 12 = 7800000.0
5. Respondent 248: CompTotal = 28000.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
6. Respondent 72793: CompTotal = 110000.0, CompFreq = C, so yearly compensation = 110000.0
7. Respondent 73113: CompTotal = 4600.0, CompFreq = B, so yearly compensation = 4600.0 * 12 = 55200.0
8. Respondent 72681: CompTotal = 70000.0, CompFreq = C, so yearly compensation = 70000.0
9. Respondent 240: CompTotal = 115000.0, CompFreq = C, so yearly compensation = 115000.0
10. Respondent 440: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C, so yearly compensation = 45000.0

### Step 2: Group by EdLevel and Calculate Average

All respondents have EdLevel = A. Thus, we calculate the average yearly compensation for EdLevel A.

Average = (636000.0 + 336000.0 + 96000.0 + 7800000.0 + 336000.0 + 110000.0 + 55200.0 + 70000.0 + 115000.0 + 45000.0) / 10

Average = 10236200.0 / 10 = 1023620.0

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average

More than double the average = 2 * 1023620.0 = 2047240.0

Checking each respondent's yearly compensation against this threshold:

1. Respondent 73018: 636000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
2. Respondent 72584: 336000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
3. Respondent 72683: 96000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
4. Respondent 29141: 7800000.0 (more than 2047240.0)
5. Respondent 248: 336000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
6. Respondent 72793: 110000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
7. Respondent 73113: 55200.0 (less than 2047240.0)
8. Respondent 72681: 70000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
9. Respondent 240: 115000.0 (less than 2047240.0)
10. Respondent 440: 45000.0 (less than 2047240.0)

Only Respondent 29141 has a yearly compensation more than double the average for their EdLevel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29141}$",False
