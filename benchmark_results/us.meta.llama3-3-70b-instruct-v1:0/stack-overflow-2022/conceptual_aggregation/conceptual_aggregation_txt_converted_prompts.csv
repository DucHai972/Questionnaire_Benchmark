<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'YearsCodePro' field in the responses, which represents the years of professional coding experience.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 392: YearsCodePro = 7
- Respondent 73100: YearsCodePro = 5
- Respondent 72776: YearsCodePro = 5
- Respondent 72897: YearsCodePro = 1
- Respondent 389: YearsCodePro = 3
- Respondent 72734: YearsCodePro = 2
- Respondent 55: YearsCodePro = 2
- Respondent 72682: YearsCodePro = 4
- Respondent 73196: YearsCodePro = 4
- Respondent 297: YearsCodePro = 3

Counting the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience:
- Respondent 392 (7 years)
- Respondent 73100 (5 years)
- Respondent 72776 (5 years)
- Respondent 72682 (4 years)
- Respondent 73196 (4 years)

There are 5 respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 10 years of professional coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'YearsCodePro' field in the responses, which represents the years of professional coding experience.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 388 has 26 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 123 has 2 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 73260 has 10 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 136 has 13 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72731 has 5 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 398 has 5 years of professional coding experience.
- Respondent 72894 has 32 years of professional coding experience.

We are looking for respondents with more than 10 years of professional coding experience. Therefore, the respondents that meet this criterion are:

- Respondent 388 with 26 years
- Respondent 136 with 13 years
- Respondent 72894 with 32 years

There are 3 respondents with more than 10 years of professional coding experience, but since Respondent 73260 has exactly 10 years, they do not meet the ""more than 10 years"" criterion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have worked with the 'Go' language?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents who have worked with the 'Go' language, we need to examine the 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith' field in each respondent's data.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 206 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 73040 mentions 'Go' in their 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith'.
- Respondent 157 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 547 does not mention 'Go' but wants to work with it.
- Respondent 72630 does not mention 'Go' but wants to work with it.
- Respondent 162 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 72753 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 72817 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 72873 does not mention 'Go'.
- Respondent 136 does not mention 'Go' but wants to work with it.
- Respondent 254 mentions 'Go' in their 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith'.
- Respondent 248 does not mention 'Go' but wants to work with it.

Only Respondent 73040 and Respondent 254 have 'Go' listed under 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith', which means they have worked with the 'Go' language.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have worked with the 'JavaScript' language?
</task>","To determine how many respondents have worked with the 'JavaScript' language, we need to examine the 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith' field in each respondent's data.

Respondent 173: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes JavaScript.
Respondent 365: No mention of JavaScript.
Respondent 211: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes JavaScript.
Respondent 72735: No mention of JavaScript.
Respondent 72969: No mention of JavaScript in LanguageHaveWorkedWith, but it is mentioned in LanguageWantToWorkWith.
Respondent 29048: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes JavaScript.
Respondent 72793: No mention of JavaScript.
Respondent 72776: No mention of JavaScript.
Respondent 73006: LanguageHaveWorkedWith includes JavaScript.

Counting the respondents who have worked with JavaScript based on the 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith' field: 
- Respondent 173
- Respondent 211
- Respondent 29048
- Respondent 73006

There are 4 respondents who have worked with the 'JavaScript' language, but also considering Respondent 72969 does not count as they have not worked with it but want to, and the same for any others not listed.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'YearsCodePro' field in the responses section, which represents the years of professional coding experience.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 29060: YearsCodePro = 14
- Respondent 206: YearsCodePro = 12
- Respondent 72720: YearsCodePro = 10
- Respondent 338: YearsCodePro = 25
- Respondent 72831: YearsCodePro = 7
- Respondent 248: YearsCodePro = 2
- Respondent 73125: YearsCodePro = 11
- Respondent 383: YearsCodePro = 6

We count the respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience:
- Respondent 29060 (14 years)
- Respondent 206 (12 years)
- Respondent 72720 (10 years)
- Respondent 338 (25 years)
- Respondent 72831 (7 years)
- Respondent 73125 (11 years)
- Respondent 383 (6 years)

There are 7 respondents with more than 3 years of professional coding experience.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with between 2 and 17 years of total coding experience who work with the 'Homebrew' tool.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and identify the respondents who meet two conditions:

1. They have between 2 and 17 years of total coding experience.
2. They work with the 'Homebrew' tool.

Based on the provided data, we can examine each respondent's 'YearsCode' and 'ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith' fields.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with between 8 and 13 years of total coding experience who work with the 'Kubernetes' tool.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'YearsCode' and 'ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith' fields in the responses.

From the responses, we can see that:

- Respondent 444 has 18 years of coding experience and works with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 430 has 40 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 72850 has 10 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 197 has 26 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 73082 has 21 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 263 has 16 years of coding experience and works with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 441 has 9 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 29043 has 16 years of coding experience and does not work with Kubernetes.
- Respondent 72891 has 20 years of coding experience and works with Kubernetes.

However, none of the respondents with between 8 and 13 years of total coding experience work with the 'Kubernetes' tool, except for none. 

Respondent 441 has 9 years of coding experience, which is within the range, but does not work with Kubernetes. 
Respondent 263 has 16 years of coding experience, which is outside the range.
Respondent 72891 has 20 years of coding experience, which is outside the range.
Respondent 444 has 18 years of coding experience, which is outside the range.

But there are no respondents with between 8 and 13 years of total coding experience who work with the 'Kubernetes' tool.

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with between 2 and 7 years of total coding experience who work with the 'Ansible' tool.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents who have between 2 and 7 years of total coding experience and work with the 'Ansible' tool.

From the data provided:

- Respondent 396 has 28 years of coding experience and works with Ansible.
- Respondent 73030 has 12 years of coding experience and works with Ansible.
- Respondent 29124 has 6 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.

However, upon closer inspection, we find that Respondent 29124 does not meet the criteria because they do not work with Ansible, but Respondent 396 and Respondent 73030 also do not meet the criteria because their years of coding experience are outside the specified range.

Respondent 547 has 8 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.
Respondent 72964 has 7 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.
Respondent 72728 has 14 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.
Respondent 110 has 7 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.
Respondent 183 has 11 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.
Respondent 424 has 3 years of coding experience and does not work with Ansible.

However, none of these respondents meet both criteria of having between 2 and 7 years of coding experience and working with Ansible, except for none. 

But we see that:
- Respondent 29124 has 6 years of coding experience and works with Ansible (via Docker;Kubernetes;npm, but Ansible is indeed mentioned in the tools for Respondent 73030 and Respondent 396).

Thus, the correct count based on the provided data is 2 respondents who work with Ansible but only one of them (Respondent 29124) meets the years of experience criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with between 2 and 12 years of total coding experience who work with the 'npm' tool.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with between 5 and 10 years of total coding experience who work with the 'Terraform' tool.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and identify respondents who meet two conditions:

1. They have between 5 and 10 years of total coding experience.
2. They work with the 'Terraform' tool.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 261 has 38 years of coding experience and works with Terraform, but does not meet the coding experience criteria.
- Respondent 420 has 8 years of coding experience and works with Terraform, meeting both criteria.
- No other respondents work with Terraform and have between 5 and 10 years of coding experience.

Therefore, the count of respondents who meet the specified conditions is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's compensation to this average to determine how many have a higher compensation.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can extract the following compensations and countries:

- United States of America: 90000.0, 400000.0, 91000.0
- Poland: 138000.0, 80000.0
- Brazil: 200000.0
- Netherlands: 83000.0, 50000.0
- Portugal: 94500.0

Calculating the average for each country:

- United States of America: (90000.0 + 400000.0 + 91000.0) / 3 = 530000.0 / 3 = 176666.67
- Poland: (138000.0 + 80000.0) / 2 = 218000.0 / 2 = 109000.0
- Brazil: 200000.0 (only one respondent)
- Netherlands: (83000.0 + 50000.0) / 2 = 133000.0 / 2 = 66500.0
- Portugal: 94500.0 (only one respondent)

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation to the Average:**

- Respondent 29113 (United States of America): 90000.0 < 176666.67
- Respondent 72712 (Poland): 138000.0 > 109000.0
- Respondent 72594 (Brazil): 200000.0 (average is the same, so not higher)
- Respondent 459 (United States of America): 400000.0 > 176666.67
- Respondent 444 (Poland): 80000.0 < 109000.0
- Respondent 72730 (Netherlands): 83000.0 > 66500.0
- Respondent 72965 (Netherlands): 50000.0 < 66500.0
- Respondent 72720 (United States of America): 91000.0 < 176666.67
- Respondent 498 (Portugal): 94500.0 (average is the same, so not higher)

3. **Count Respondents with Higher Compensation than Average:**

From the comparisons, the respondents with a total compensation higher than the average for their country are:

- Respondent 72712
- Respondent 459
- Respondent 72730

Therefore, there are **3** respondents with a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's compensation to this average.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can extract the following data for total compensation (CompTotal) and country:

- Estonia: 3000.0
- France: 1100.0
- United States of America: 204300.0, 310000.0, 100000.0, 100000.0
- Mexico: 12000.0
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 47000.0, 100000.0
- Costa Rica: 800000.0
- Poland: 500000.0

Calculating averages:

- Estonia: 3000.0
- France: 1100.0
- United States of America: (204300.0 + 310000.0 + 100000.0 + 100000.0) / 4 = 178825.0
- Mexico: 12000.0
- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: (47000.0 + 100000.0) / 2 = 73500.0
- Costa Rica: 800000.0
- Poland: 500000.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

Now, we compare each respondent's total compensation to the average for their country:

- Respondent 73147 (Estonia): 3000.0 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 430 (France): 1100.0 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 73094 (United States of America): 204300.0 (lower than the average)
- Respondent 293 (United States of America): 310000.0 (higher than the average)
- Respondent 72894 (Mexico): 12000.0 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 359 (United States of America): 100000.0 (lower than the average)
- Respondent 72749 (United States of America): 100000.0 (lower than the average)
- Respondent 508 (Costa Rica): 800000.0 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 349 (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): 47000.0 (lower than the average)
- Respondent 73078 (Poland): 500000.0 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 72981 (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland): 100000.0 (higher than the average)

3. **Count Respondents with Higher Compensation:**

From the comparisons, the respondents with a total compensation higher than the average for their country are:

- Respondent 293
- Respondent 72981

Therefore, there are **2** respondents with a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's total compensation to this average to determine how many have a higher total compensation than their country's average.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can calculate the average compensation for each country. We'll need to group respondents by their country and sum their total compensations, then divide by the number of respondents in each country.

- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:** Respondents 122 and 72584.
  - Total Compensation: 104000.0 + 28000.0 = 132000.0
  - Average: 132000.0 / 2 = 66000.0
- **Austria:** Respondent 427.
  - Total Compensation: 38000.0
  - Average: 38000.0 / 1 = 38000.0
- **Poland:** Respondent 72944.
  - Total Compensation: 200000.0
  - Average: 200000.0 / 1 = 200000.0
- **France:** Respondent 72899.
  - Total Compensation: 33500.0
  - Average: 33500.0 / 1 = 33500.0
- **Japan:** Respondent 73129.
  - Total Compensation: 320000.0
  - Average: 320000.0 / 1 = 320000.0
- **Kyrgyzstan:** Respondent 73024.
  - Total Compensation: 11000.0
  - Average: 11000.0 / 1 = 11000.0
- **Spain:** Respondent 501.
  - Total Compensation: 29000.0
  - Average: 29000.0 / 1 = 29000.0
- **Belgium:** Respondent 510.
  - Total Compensation: 4600.0
  - Average: 4600.0 / 1 = 4600.0
- **India:** Respondent 72842.
  - Total Compensation: 55000.0
  - Average: 55000.0 / 1 = 55000.0
- **Montenegro:** Respondent 73007.
  - Total Compensation: 0.0
  - Average: 0.0 / 1 = 0.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation to Their Country's Average:**

Now, we compare each respondent's total compensation to the average for their country to find out who has a higher total compensation.

- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:**
  - Respondent 122: 104000.0 > 66000.0 (Yes)
  - Respondent 72584: 28000.0 < 66000.0 (No)
- **Austria:** 
  - Respondent 427: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Poland:**
  - Respondent 72944: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **France:**
  - Respondent 72899: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Japan:**
  - Respondent 73129: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Kyrgyzstan:**
  - Respondent 73024: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Spain:**
  - Respondent 501: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Belgium:**
  - Respondent 510: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **India:**
  - Respondent 72842: Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.
- **Montenegro:**
  - Respondent 73007: Since there's only one respondent and their compensation is 0, we cannot compare in a meaningful way.

Given the data and the task, we can only meaningfully compare respondents from the **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland** since it's the only country with more than one respondent. 

From the comparison, only **Respondent 122** has a total compensation higher than the average for their country.

Therefore, based on the provided data and the specific question asked, the answer is **1**.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total compensation (yearly) that is higher than the average compensation for their country?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total compensation for each country and then compare each respondent's total compensation to this average.

1. **Calculate Average Compensation by Country:**

From the responses, we can extract the following total compensations and countries:

- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 72,000.0 (Respondent 73096), 40,000.0 (Respondent 72690)
- United States of America: 155,000.0 (Respondent 73067)
- Israel: 33,000.0 (Respondent 29106)
- Portugal: 2,500.0 (Respondent 193)
- Germany: 100,000.0 (Respondent 73128)
- Russian Federation: 650,000.0 (Respondent 29141)
- Pakistan: 1,632,000.0 (Respondent 57)

Average compensations:
- United Kingdom: (72,000.0 + 40,000.0) / 2 = 56,000.0
- United States: 155,000.0 (only one respondent)
- Israel: 33,000.0
- Portugal: 2,500.0
- Germany: 100,000.0
- Russian Federation: 650,000.0
- Pakistan: 1,632,000.0

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Compensation:**

- Respondent 73096 (UK): 72,000.0 > 56,000.0
- Respondent 73067 (USA): 155,000.0 (no average to compare, as there's only one respondent from the USA, but we can consider this respondent as not comparable due to lack of average)
- Respondent 29106 (Israel): 33,000.0 = 33,000.0 (not higher)
- Respondent 193 (Portugal): 2,500.0 = 2,500.0 (not higher)
- Respondent 72690 (UK): 40,000.0 < 56,000.0
- Respondent 73128 (Germany): 100,000.0 = 100,000.0 (not higher)
- Respondent 29141 (Russian Federation): 650,000.0 = 650,000.0 (not higher)
- Respondent 57 (Pakistan): 1,632,000.0 = 1,632,000.0 (not higher)

Only Respondent 73096 has a total compensation higher than the average for their country.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCodePro refers to the years of professional coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCodePro for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 29038: YearsCodePro = 11
   - Respondent 73094: YearsCodePro = 17
   - Respondent 72836: YearsCodePro = 14
   - Respondent 73254: YearsCodePro = 2
   - Respondent 72582: YearsCodePro = 6
   - Respondent 72989: YearsCodePro = 9
   - Respondent 382: YearsCodePro = 6
   Average for EdLevel A = (11 + 17 + 14 + 2 + 6 + 9 + 6) / 7 = 65 / 7 = 9.29

2. EdLevel B (Secondary school):
   - Respondent 165: YearsCodePro = 11
   Average for EdLevel B = 11 / 1 = 11

3. EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
   - Respondent 259: YearsCodePro = 4
   Average for EdLevel C = 4 / 1 = 4

Since there's only one respondent for EdLevels B and C, and no respondents for other levels, we'll proceed with the calculation for EdLevel A and the single instances for B and C.

Now, let's identify respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level:

1. EdLevel A:
   - Average = 9.29
   - Respondents above average: 
     - Respondent 73094 (17 years)
     - Respondent 72836 (14 years)
     - Respondent 29038 (11 years)
     - Respondent 72989 (9 years) is below average.
     - Respondent 72582 (6 years) is below average.
     - Respondent 382 (6 years) is below average.
     - Respondent 73254 (2 years) is below average.

2. EdLevel B:
   - Average = 11
   - Since there's only one respondent, there's no average to compare against in a meaningful way for this level.

3. EdLevel C:
   - Average = 4
   - Since there's only one respondent, there's no average to compare against in a meaningful way for this level.

Counting the respondents with more experience than the average for their education level, we find:
- For EdLevel A: 3 respondents (73094, 72836, 29038)

Given the data and the specific question, the count of respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level, considering only EdLevel A due to the lack of comparative data for other levels, is 3. However, this task requires a precise count based on the provided data, and since we cannot accurately calculate averages for EdLevels B and C due to insufficient data, the count remains focused on EdLevel A. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCodePro refers to the years of professional coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCodePro for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 72813: YearsCodePro = 15
   - Respondent 72887: YearsCodePro = 1
   - Respondent 441: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent 72856: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent 73082: YearsCodePro = 15
   - Respondent 72706: YearsCodePro = 3
   Average for A = (15 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 15 + 3) / 6 = 44 / 6 = 7.33

2. EdLevel B (Secondary school):
   - Respondent 539: YearsCodePro = 7
   - Respondent 73075: YearsCodePro = 23
   Average for B = (7 + 23) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

3. EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
   - Respondent 72833: YearsCodePro = 8
   Average for C = 8 / 1 = 8

Since there's only one respondent for EdLevel C and none for the other levels (D to I), we can't calculate averages for those. However, we can still compare the respondents within the levels we have data for.

Now, let's identify respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level:

1. EdLevel A:
   - Average is 7.33 years
   - Respondent 72813: 15 years (more than average)
   - Respondent 72887: 1 year (less than average)
   - Respondent 441: 5 years (less than average)
   - Respondent 72856: 5 years (less than average)
   - Respondent 73082: 15 years (more than average)
   - Respondent 72706: 3 years (less than average)
   So, 2 respondents (72813, 73082) have more experience than the average.

2. EdLevel B:
   - Average is 15 years
   - Respondent 539: 7 years (less than average)
   - Respondent 73075: 23 years (more than average)
   So, 1 respondent (73075) has more experience than the average.

3. EdLevel C:
   - Since there's only one respondent, we cannot compare.

Counting the respondents with more professional coding experience than the average for their education level, we have 2 from EdLevel A and 1 from EdLevel B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents in their same organization size?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to identify the top 3 most desired languages among all respondents, and then determine the organization sizes. Afterward, we can count how many respondents have worked with a language that is also one of the top 3 most desired languages within their same organization size.

1. **Identify Top 3 Most Desired Languages:**
   - From the responses, we collect all the languages mentioned in ""LanguageWantToWorkWith"" and count their occurrences.
   - The top 3 most desired languages are Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS (based on their frequent mentions across respondents).

2. **Determine Organization Sizes and Count Respondents:**
   - We categorize respondents by their organization size and check if they have worked with any of the top 3 desired languages (Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS).
   - Respondents who have worked with at least one of these languages in their respective organization sizes are counted.

**Organization Sizes and Respondents:**
- **10 to 19 employees:** Respondent 73206 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS), Respondent 427 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS)
- **20 to 99 employees:** Respondent 72814 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS), Respondent 72719 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS), Respondent 110 (worked with JavaScript, HTML/CSS), Respondent 72803 (worked with Python)
- **100 to 499 employees:** Respondent 72962 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS), Respondent 73095 (worked with Python)
- **1,000 to 4,999 employees:** Respondent 73106 (worked with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS)
- **10,000 or more employees:** No respondent worked with any of the top 3 desired languages.
- **Other sizes:** Respondent 72604 did not work with Python but worked with JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

**Counting Respondents:**
- From the analysis, we see that 9 respondents have worked with at least one of the top 3 most desired languages within their organization size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average years of professional coding experience for each education level. Then, we compare each respondent's years of professional coding experience to this average for their respective education level and count those who have more experience.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- EdLevel refers to the highest level of education, with options from A (Primary/elementary school) to I (Something else).
- YearsCodePro refers to the years of professional coding experience.

Let's calculate the average YearsCodePro for each EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
   - Respondent 352: YearsCodePro = 4
   - Respondent 72819: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent 72872: YearsCodePro = 5
   - Respondent 73138: YearsCodePro = 4
   - Respondent 72945: YearsCodePro = 8
   - Average for EdLevel A = (4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 8) / 5 = 26 / 5 = 5.2

2. EdLevel B (Secondary school):
   - Respondent 396: YearsCodePro = 34
   - Average for EdLevel B = 34 / 1 = 34

Since there's only one respondent for EdLevel B and none for other levels (C to I), we can't calculate averages for those. However, we can proceed with the comparison for EdLevel A and the single respondent for EdLevel B.

Now, let's compare each respondent's YearsCodePro to the average for their EdLevel:

1. EdLevel A:
   - Respondent 352: 4 vs 5.2 (less)
   - Respondent 72819: 5 vs 5.2 (less)
   - Respondent 72872: 5 vs 5.2 (less)
   - Respondent 73138: 4 vs 5.2 (less)
   - Respondent 72945: 8 vs 5.2 (more)

2. EdLevel B:
   - Respondent 396: 34 (since there's no average to compare, we consider this respondent as having more experience than the average for their level by default, but for accuracy in counting, we should only count those above the average of their group. Given there's only one in this group, the comparison isn't meaningful in the context of ""more than average,"" but we note the experience is significant.)

Given the instructions, we are looking for respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level. From the calculations:

- Only Respondent 72945 has more experience than the average for EdLevel A.
- For EdLevel B, since there's only one respondent, the concept of ""average"" doesn't apply in a comparative sense, so we don't count this respondent in the ""more than average"" category based on the provided data and instructions.

Therefore, the count of respondents who have more professional coding experience than the average for their education level is 1.",True
