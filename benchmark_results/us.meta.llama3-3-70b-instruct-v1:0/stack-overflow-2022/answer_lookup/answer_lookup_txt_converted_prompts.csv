</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro?
</task>","To find the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro, we need to examine the 'YearsCodePro' field for each respondent and identify the smallest value. Then, we will look at the 'ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith' field for that respondent to answer the question.

Upon reviewing the data:

- Respondent 332: YearsCodePro = 7
- Respondent 29114: YearsCodePro = 5
- Respondent 72766: YearsCodePro = 3
- Respondent 391: YearsCodePro = 15
- Respondent 73023: YearsCodePro = 20
- Respondent 73094: YearsCodePro = 17
- Respondent 50: YearsCodePro = 2
- Respondent 72962: YearsCodePro = 8
- Respondent 73020: YearsCodePro = 1
- Respondent 261: YearsCodePro = 36
- Respondent 72894: YearsCodePro = 32

The lowest YearsCodePro value is 1, which belongs to Respondent 73020.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the DevType of the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git' and then determine their DevType.

According to the 'questions' section, VersionControlSystem is a MCQ field with options:
A. Git
B. Mercurial
C. SVN
D. I don't use one

We are looking for respondents with VersionControlSystem = 'Git', which corresponds to option A.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find that several respondents have VersionControlSystem = A, which maps to 'Git' according to the schema. 

For example, Respondent 450 has:
VersionControlSystem: A

Which maps to 'Git'. Their DevType is:
DevType: Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack

Similarly, other respondents like 391, 259, 326, 73209, 72965, 447, 194, 185, and 499 also have VersionControlSystem = A, mapping to 'Git'. 

Their respective DevType are:
- Respondent 391: Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Database administrator;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.);System administrator
- Respondent 259: Developer, back-end
- Respondent 326: Engineer, site reliability;Developer, back-end;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer
- Respondent 73209: Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack
- Respondent 72965: Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Developer, back-end;Academic researcher;Scientist
- Respondent 447: Developer, back-end;Engineering manager;Cloud infrastructure engineer
- Respondent 194: Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Data or business analyst
- Respondent 185: Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, QA or test;Cloud infrastructure engineer
- Respondent 499: Developer, back-end

However, the task asks for the DevType of the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git', and since multiple respondents meet this criterion, it seems the question might be aiming for a specific or the first occurrence. Without further specification, it's reasonable to provide the DevType of the first respondent that matches the condition, which is Respondent 450.

The final answer is: Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the YearsCode of the respondent with the highest CompTotal?
</task>","To find the YearsCode of the respondent with the highest CompTotal, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest CompTotal and then find their YearsCode.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 73090 has a CompTotal of 200000.0
- Respondent 193 has a CompTotal of 2500.0
- Respondent 499 has a CompTotal of 350000.0
- Respondent 391 has a CompTotal of 130000.0
- Respondent 29124 has a CompTotal of 160000.0
- Respondent 72823 has a CompTotal of 65000.0
- Respondent 73053 has a CompTotal of 200000000.0
- Respondent 484 has a CompTotal of 160000.0

The highest CompTotal is 200000000.0, which belongs to Respondent 73053.

Now, looking at Respondent 73053's data, their YearsCode is 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Employment of the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git' and then determine their Employment.

According to the schema, VersionControlSystem is a MCQ field with options:
A. Git
B. Mercurial
C. SVN
D. I don't use one

We need to find the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'A' (since 'A' corresponds to 'Git').

After reviewing the responses, we find that several respondents have VersionControlSystem = 'A', which corresponds to 'Git'. 

For example, Respondent 537 has VersionControlSystem: A, and their Employment is A, which corresponds to ""Employed, full-time"".

Since multiple respondents have VersionControlSystem = 'Git', we can provide the Employment for any of them. Let's take Respondent 537 as an example.

The Employment for Respondent 537 is ""Employed, full-time"". 

The final answer is: Employed, full-time",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the CompFreq of the respondent with Employment = 'A'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with Employment = 'A' and then determine their CompFreq.

According to the 'questions' section, Employment is a MCQ-Multi field with option A being ""Employed, full-time"". 

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that several respondents have Employment = 'A' or have 'A' in their Employment list, but since we are looking for CompFreq which is a MCQ field with options A. Weekly, B. Monthly, C. Yearly, we will map the CompFreq code of these respondents to the corresponding option text.

Respondent 72945 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'B', which maps to ""Monthly"".
Respondent 72762 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'C', which maps to ""Yearly"".
Respondent 73117 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'B', which maps to ""Monthly"".
Respondent 72761 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'C', which maps to ""Yearly"".
Respondent 540 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'C', which maps to ""Yearly"".
Respondent 479 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'B', which maps to ""Monthly"".
Respondent 238 has Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'C', which maps to ""Yearly"".

However, the task does not specify which respondent to choose, so based on the first respondent that matches the criteria (Respondent 72945), the CompFreq is ""Monthly"". 

The final answer is: Monthly",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the DevType of the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' and then determine their DevType.

According to the 'questions' section, MainBranch is a MCQ field with the following options:
A. I am a developer by profession
B. I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work
C. I used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am
D. I am learning to code
E. I code primarily as a hobby
F. None of these

We are looking for respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', which corresponds to option A.

After examining the 'responses' section, we find that several respondents have MainBranch = A, which means they are developers by profession. 

The DevType for these respondents are:
- Respondent 73059: Developer, full-stack
- Respondent 72825: Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end
- Respondent 72668: Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Developer, front-end;Engineer, data;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Scientist
- Respondent 72796: Developer, full-stack
- Respondent 306: Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, desktop or enterprise applications;Designer
- Respondent 255: Developer, full-stack
- Respondent 492: Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Developer, front-end;Developer, full-stack;Developer, back-end;Developer, mobile;DevOps specialist;Cloud infrastructure engineer;Blockchain
- Respondent 72965: Data scientist or machine learning specialist;Developer, back-end;Academic researcher;Scientist
- Respondent 263: Developer, back-end

Since the question asks for the DevType of the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', we can provide the DevType for any of the above respondents. However, to follow the format and provide a single answer, we will choose one respondent. 

Let's take Respondent 73059 as an example. Their DevType is Developer, full-stack.

</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' and then provide their LanguageHaveWorkedWith.

From the 'questions' section, we see that MainBranch is a MCQ with option A being 'I am a developer by profession'. So, we are looking for a respondent with MainBranch = 'A'.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find several respondents with MainBranch = 'A'. We will provide the LanguageHaveWorkedWith for each of them:

- Respondent 72778: HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript
- Respondent 433: Bash/Shell;Elixir;Java;Kotlin;Python;Rust;Scala;SQL
- Respondent 72626: HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PHP;Ruby;SQL;TypeScript
- Respondent 60: C#;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;Python;SQL
- Respondent 205: Bash/Shell;Go;MATLAB;Python;R;SQL

Since the question asks for the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' without specifying which one if there are multiple, and given the format requirements, it seems we should provide the information for each matching respondent. However, following the output rules strictly and the nature of the question, it seems more appropriate to clarify that multiple respondents match the criteria, but the format does not explicitly allow for explanatory text or multiple answers in the specified output format. Thus, based on the provided instructions and the need to adhere strictly to the format, I will select one respondent's answer for demonstration purposes, acknowledging this does not fully capture the complexity of the data:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the YearsCode of the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git' and then look at their YearsCode.

According to the schema, VersionControlSystem is a MCQ with option A being 'Git'. So, we are looking for respondents with VersionControlSystem = 'A'.

Looking at the responses, we can see that several respondents have VersionControlSystem = 'A', which corresponds to 'Git'. 

For Respondent 73099, YearsCode is 9.
For Respondent 73051, YearsCode is 6.
For Respondent 73021, YearsCode is 10.
For Respondent 412, YearsCode is 11.
For Respondent 359, YearsCode is 12.
For Respondent 143, YearsCode is 12.
For Respondent 361, YearsCode is 15.
For Respondent 72744, YearsCode is 7.
For Respondent 73195, YearsCode is 15.
For Respondent 168, YearsCode is 5.

Since the question asks for the YearsCode of the respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git', and there are multiple respondents with VersionControlSystem = 'Git', the question is ambiguous. However, following the format to the letter as requested, I will provide the YearsCode of the first respondent with VersionControlSystem = 'Git', which is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the EdLevel of the respondent with the highest YearsCode among those with Employment = 'A'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents with Employment = 'A'.
2. Among these, find the one with the highest YearsCode.
3. Determine the EdLevel of this respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that Employment = 'A' means ""Employed, full-time"".

Looking at the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 72929: Employment = A, YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 72603: Employment = A, YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 73031: Employment = A, YearsCode = 4
- Respondent 72964: Employment = A, YearsCode = 7
- Respondent 72705: Employment = A, YearsCode = 7

The highest YearsCode among those with Employment = 'A' is 9, which is shared by Respondent 72929 and Respondent 72603.

For Respondent 72929, EdLevel = A, which according to the schema means ""Primary/elementary school"".
For Respondent 72603, EdLevel = A, which also means ""Primary/elementary school"".

Since both respondents with the highest YearsCode have the same EdLevel, the answer is ""Primary/elementary school"".",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those with Country = 'Czech Republic'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents with Country = 'Czech Republic'.
2. Among these, find the one with the lowest YearsCodePro.
3. Report the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith for this respondent.

From the provided data, the respondent with Country = 'Czech Republic' is Respondent 382. 

Respondent 382 has:
- YearsCodePro: 6
- ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith: npm

Since there is only one respondent from the Czech Republic, this respondent automatically has the lowest YearsCodePro among those from the Czech Republic.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those with Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents with Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.
2. Among these, find the one with the lowest YearsCodePro.
3. Report the LanguageHaveWorkedWith for this respondent.

From the responses section, we can see that there are two respondents from the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland': Respondent 72958 and Respondent 72909.

- Respondent 72958 has YearsCodePro = 5.
- Respondent 72909 has YearsCodePro = 20.

The respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those from the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' is Respondent 72958, with YearsCodePro = 5.

The LanguageHaveWorkedWith for Respondent 72958 is: Bash/Shell;C;C#;C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;Python;Rust;SQL;TypeScript.

Therefore, the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those with Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' is Bash/Shell;C;C#;C++;HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;Python;Rust;SQL;TypeScript.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the YearsCode of the respondent whose total years of coding experience (YearsCode + YearsCodePro) was exactly 23?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total years of coding experience (YearsCode + YearsCodePro) was exactly 23, we need to examine each respondent's data.

Respondent 29105: YearsCode = 3, YearsCodePro = Less than 1 year. Total is less than 4, so it's not 23.
Respondent 73119: YearsCode = 9, YearsCodePro = 7. Total is 16, so it's not 23.
Respondent 72682: YearsCode = 7, YearsCodePro = 4. Total is 11, so it's not 23.
Respondent 29122: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 8. Total is 20, so it's not 23.

From the responses, we can see that Respondent 73122, Respondent 104, Respondent 442, Respondent 72681, and Respondent 391 have Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'C'. 

The YearsCode for these respondents are:
- Respondent 73122: 6
- Respondent 104: 5
- Respondent 442: 6
- Respondent 72681: 20
- Respondent 391: 28

Since the question asks for the YearsCode of the respondent with Employment = 'A' and CompFreq = 'Yearly', and there are multiple respondents that match this condition, the question is ambiguous. However, based on the provided instructions, it seems that we should provide the YearsCode for each of these respondents. 

But, given the format requirements, it seems we need to provide a single answer or a list. The question does not specify what to do in the case of multiple matches, so following the format to the letter as requested and considering the nature of the task, I will provide the list of YearsCode values for the matching respondents:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
What is the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the highest CompTotal among those with CompFreq = 'Yearly'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents with CompFreq = 'Yearly', which corresponds to option C in the CompFreq question. Then, among these respondents, we need to find the one with the highest CompTotal. Finally, we will determine the LanguageHaveWorkedWith for this respondent.

From the responses, the respondents with CompFreq = 'Yearly' (C) are:
- Respondent 323
- Respondent 72714
- Respondent 225
- Respondent 73148
- Respondent 72753
- Respondent 72991

Now, let's compare their CompTotal values:
- Respondent 323: 42000.0
- Respondent 72714: 140000.0
- Respondent 225: 49000.0
- Respondent 73148: 124800.0
- Respondent 72753: 24000.0
- Respondent 72991: 146400.0

The respondent with the highest CompTotal among these is Respondent 72714, with a CompTotal of 140000.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', which corresponds to option A in the MainBranch question.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the lowest YearsCodePro.
3. Report the LanguageHaveWorkedWith for this respondent.

From the responses provided:

- Respondent 72851: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 20
- Respondent 72835: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 10
- Respondent 72829: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = Less than 1 year
- Respondent 192: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 1
- Respondent 154: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 4
- Respondent 548: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 3
- Respondent 72927: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 13
- Respondent 448: MainBranch = A, YearsCodePro = 4

The respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro is Respondent 72829 with ""Less than 1 year"" of professional coding experience. 

The LanguageHaveWorkedWith for Respondent 72829 is: Assembly;Bash/Shell;C;C++;MATLAB

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the CompTotal of the respondent with Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' and MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' and MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', and then provide their CompTotal.

From the responses, we can see that Respondent 73096 and Respondent 73021 have Country = 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. 

Respondent 73096 has MainBranch: A, which according to the schema corresponds to 'I am a developer by profession'. Their CompTotal is 72000.0.

Respondent 73021 also has MainBranch: A, which corresponds to 'I am a developer by profession'. Their CompTotal is 33400.0.

Since there are multiple respondents that match the criteria, we need to provide both values. However, the task seems to imply a single answer, which might be an oversight in the task description given the provided data. Following the instructions to the letter as requested, I will provide the CompTotal for the first matching respondent as that seems to be the most direct interpretation of the task given.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the EdLevel of the respondent with the highest YearsCode among those with Employment = 'A'?
</task>","To find the EdLevel of the respondent with the highest YearsCode among those with Employment = 'A', we first need to identify all respondents with Employment = 'A' and then compare their YearsCode to find the highest. After identifying the respondent with the highest YearsCode, we will determine their EdLevel.

From the responses:
- Respondent 499: Employment = A, YearsCode = 14
- Respondent 46: Employment = A, YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 513: Employment = A, YearsCode = 8
- Respondent 382: Employment = A, YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 73143: Employment = A, YearsCode = 6
- Respondent 72991: Employment = A, YearsCode = 6
- Respondent 29124: Employment = A, YearsCode = 6
- Respondent 395: Employment = A, YearsCode = 5
- Respondent 29056: Employment = ['A', 'C'], which includes A, YearsCode = 7

Comparing the YearsCode among these respondents:
- The highest YearsCode is 14, which belongs to Respondent 499.

Now, looking at the EdLevel for Respondent 499:
- EdLevel: A, which corresponds to ""Primary/elementary school"" according to the schema.

Therefore, the EdLevel of the respondent with the highest YearsCode among those with Employment = 'A' is Primary/elementary school.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the CompFreq of the respondent with Employment = 'A' and MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who match the given criteria: Employment = 'A' and MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'. 

According to the schema, Employment 'A' corresponds to ""Employed, full-time"" and MainBranch 'A' corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"". 

We then examine the responses to find matches. Respondents 72841, 72913, 72604, 259, 297, 403, 73219, 143, 72754, 72932, and 72719 have Employment = 'A' and MainBranch = 'A', which matches our criteria.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that all these respondents have MainBranch = 'A', which indeed corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"". So, we look at their CompFreq values.

The CompFreq for these respondents are as follows:
- Respondent 72841: C (which corresponds to ""Yearly"")
- Respondent 72913: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 72604: C (which corresponds to ""Yearly"")
- Respondent 259: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 297: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 403: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 73219: C (which corresponds to ""Yearly"")
- Respondent 143: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 72754: C (which corresponds to ""Yearly"")
- Respondent 72932: B (which corresponds to ""Monthly"")
- Respondent 72719: C (which corresponds to ""Yearly"")

Since the question asks for the CompFreq of the respondent with the specified criteria and does not specify further conditions to narrow down to a single respondent, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed because multiple respondents fit the criteria given. However, following the instructions to provide a direct and concise answer based on the data provided and the format specified, and considering that the task does not explicitly ask for a list or a count but rather ""the CompFreq,"" it appears there's an expectation to provide a singular answer where multiple exist.

Given the constraints of the format and the task, and to adhere strictly to the instructions provided without making assumptions beyond the data given, the most fitting approach would be to list the CompFreq values corresponding to the matching respondents. But, since the format demands a singular final answer and it's not feasible to provide a list as per the instructions, I will proceed with the first matching respondent's CompFreq value as the final answer, acknowledging this does not fully address the potential multiplicity of answers.

The final answer is: Yearly",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the CompFreq of the respondent whose CompTotal is lower than the average CompTotal for all respondents with Employment = 'A' in this case?
</task>","To determine the CompFreq of the respondent whose CompTotal is lower than the average CompTotal for all respondents with Employment = 'A', we first need to calculate the average CompTotal for respondents with Employment = 'A'.

Respondents with Employment = 'A' are:
- Respondent 72945: CompTotal = 60000.0
- Respondent 423: CompTotal = 2600.0
- Respondent 143: CompTotal = 4250.0
- Respondent 133: CompTotal = 1680.0
- Respondent 72762: CompTotal = 300000.0
- Respondent 72591: CompTotal = 4200.0
- Respondent 72663: CompTotal = 65000.0

Average CompTotal = (60000.0 + 2600.0 + 4250.0 + 1680.0 + 300000.0 + 4200.0 + 65000.0) / 7
Average CompTotal = 368370.0 / 7
Average CompTotal = 52610.0

Now, we need to find the respondent with Employment = 'A' whose CompTotal is lower than this average (52610.0) and determine their CompFreq.

Respondents with CompTotal lower than 52610.0 are:
- Respondent 423: CompTotal = 2600.0, CompFreq = B
- Respondent 143: CompTotal = 4250.0, CompFreq = B
- Respondent 133: CompTotal = 1680.0, CompFreq = B
- Respondent 72591: CompTotal = 4200.0, CompFreq = B
- Respondent 72945: CompTotal = 60000.0, which is higher than the average, so it's not this one.
- Respondent 72762: CompTotal = 300000.0, which is higher than the average, so it's not this one.
- Respondent 72663: CompTotal = 65000.0, which is higher than the average, so it's not this one.

Among these, all have CompFreq = B, which corresponds to ""Monthly"" according to the schema.

The final answer is: Monthly",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the EdLevel of the respondent whose YearsCode is higher than the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' in this case?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'. Then, we find the respondent with YearsCode higher than this average and determine their EdLevel.

1. **Identify respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'**: 
   - MainBranch is coded as ""A. I am a developer by profession"". So, we look for respondents with MainBranch = 'A'.

2. **Calculate the average YearsCode for these respondents**:
   - Respondent 260: YearsCode = 10
   - Respondent 143: YearsCode = 12
   - Respondent 73211: YearsCode = 10
   - Respondent 72669: YearsCode = 18
   - Respondent 73073: YearsCode = 25
   - Respondent 291: YearsCode = 15
   - Respondent 160: YearsCode = 4
   - Respondent 72773: YearsCode = 12
   - Respondent 72856: YearsCode = 12
   - Respondent 73085: YearsCode = 4

   Average YearsCode = (10 + 12 + 10 + 18 + 25 + 15 + 4 + 12 + 12 + 4) / 10 = 122 / 10 = 12.2

3. **Find the respondent with YearsCode higher than the average (12.2)**:
   - Respondent 72669: YearsCode = 18 (higher than 12.2)
   - Respondent 73073: YearsCode = 25 (higher than 12.2)
   - Respondent 291: YearsCode = 15 (higher than 12.2)

   Among these, we need to identify the one with the highest YearsCode above the average or clarify the question's intent. However, the task seems to ask for a single EdLevel without specifying further conditions for multiple respondents above the average. Given this, we'll proceed with the respondent having the highest YearsCode above the average for a direct answer.

4. **Determine the EdLevel of the respondent with the highest YearsCode above the average**:
   - The respondent with the highest YearsCode above the average is Respondent 73073, with EdLevel = A.

According to the schema, EdLevel A corresponds to ""Primary/elementary school"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{Primary/elementary school}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent whose YearsCode is lower than the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' in this case?
</task>","To find the LanguageHaveWorkedWith of the respondent whose YearsCode is lower than the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', we first need to calculate the average YearsCode for the specified group.

MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' corresponds to option A. 

Respondents with MainBranch = A are:
- Respondent 548: YearsCode = 5
- Respondent 213: YearsCode = 20
- Respondent 73190: YearsCode = 15
- Respondent 73107: YearsCode = 5
- Respondent 72746: YearsCode = 3
- Respondent 364: YearsCode = 12
- Respondent 72754: YearsCode = 7
- Respondent 72773: YearsCode = 12
- Respondent 115: YearsCode = 20

Average YearsCode = (5 + 20 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 12 + 7 + 12 + 20) / 9 = 99 / 9 = 11

Now, we need to find the respondent with YearsCode lower than 11 among the ones with MainBranch = A.

Respondents with YearsCode lower than 11 are:
- Respondent 73107: YearsCode = 5, LanguageHaveWorkedWith = Java;Scala;TypeScript
- Respondent 72746: YearsCode = 3, LanguageHaveWorkedWith = HTML/CSS;JavaScript;TypeScript
- Respondent 548: YearsCode = 5, LanguageHaveWorkedWith = HTML/CSS;JavaScript;PowerShell;SQL;TypeScript
- Respondent 72754: YearsCode = 7, LanguageHaveWorkedWith = HTML/CSS;JavaScript;Python;SQL

Among these, the ones with the lowest YearsCode are Respondent 72746 with YearsCode = 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the LanguageWantToWorkWith of the respondent with the lowest YearsCodePro among those with EdLevel = 'Primary/elementary school'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents with EdLevel = 'Primary/elementary school'.
2. Among them, find the one with the lowest YearsCodePro.
3. Report the LanguageWantToWorkWith of this respondent.

From the provided data, we can see that there are a few respondents with EdLevel = 'Primary/elementary school', which corresponds to option A in the EdLevel question. Let's list them out and their respective YearsCodePro:

- Respondent 29049: EdLevel = A, YearsCodePro = 15
- Respondent 72837 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 72741 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 72686: EdLevel = A, YearsCodePro = 4
- Respondent 424: EdLevel = A, YearsCodePro = 2
- Respondent 73148 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 375 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 312 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 72848 does not have EdLevel = A.
- Respondent 72911 does not have EdLevel = A.

Among these, Respondent 424 has the lowest YearsCodePro with a value of 2.

Now, let's find the LanguageWantToWorkWith for Respondent 424:

LanguageWantToWorkWith for Respondent 424 is HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;PHP;SQL.

The final answer is: HTML/CSS;Java;JavaScript;PHP;SQL.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith of the respondent whose YearsCode is lower than the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' in this case?
</task>","To find the answer, we first need to calculate the average YearsCode for all respondents with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'. Then, we identify the respondent(s) with YearsCode lower than this average and report their ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith.

From the provided data, the respondents with MainBranch = 'A' (which corresponds to 'I am a developer by profession') are:

- Respondent 359: YearsCode = 12
- Respondent 382: YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 537: YearsCode = 9
- Respondent 72850: YearsCode = 10
- Respondent 406: YearsCode = 14
- Respondent 29143: YearsCode = 14
- Respondent 424: YearsCode = 3
- Respondent 73144: YearsCode = 7

The average YearsCode for these respondents is calculated as (12 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 14 + 3 + 7) / 8 = 78 / 8 = 9.75.

Now, we look for respondents with YearsCode lower than 9.75:

- Respondent 382: YearsCode = 9, ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = npm
- Respondent 537: YearsCode = 9, ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Ansible;Docker;npm
- Respondent 424: YearsCode = 3, ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = npm
- Respondent 73144: YearsCode = 7, ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker;Homebrew;Kubernetes;npm

Among these, the ones with YearsCode lower than the average are:

- Respondent 382
- Respondent 537
- Respondent 424
- Respondent 73144

However, the task seems to imply a singular respondent, but based on the calculation, there are multiple respondents whose YearsCode is lower than the average. Following the instructions to the letter as requested, I will provide the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith for each of these respondents, but since the format demands a single final answer and it seems there was an expectation for a singular respondent, I will list them as the task does not specify how to handle multiple respondents:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the CompFreq of the respondent whose total years of coding experience (YearsCode + YearsCodePro) was exactly 17?
</task>","To find the CompFreq of the respondent whose total years of coding experience (YearsCode + YearsCodePro) was exactly 17, we need to examine each respondent's data.

Respondent 52: YearsCode = 6, YearsCodePro = 1, Total = 7
Respondent 29143: YearsCode = 14, YearsCodePro = 9, Total = 23
Respondent 72805: YearsCode = 12, YearsCodePro = 6, Total = 18

Respondent 72712: YearsCode = 4, YearsCodePro = 5, Total = 9
Respondent 323: YearsCode = 10, YearsCodePro = 7, Total = 17

The respondent with a total of 17 years of coding experience is Respondent 323. According to the data, Respondent 323's CompFreq is C, which corresponds to ""Yearly"" in the schema.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith of the respondent whose CompTotal is lower than the average CompTotal for all respondents with Employment = 'A' in this case?
</task>","To find the answer, we first need to calculate the average CompTotal for all respondents with Employment = 'A'. Then, we identify the respondent(s) with CompTotal lower than this average and report their ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith.

1. **Identify respondents with Employment = 'A'**:
   - Respondent 382: Employment = A, CompTotal = 120000.0
   - Respondent 225: Employment = A, CompTotal = 49000.0
   - Respondent 73147: Employment = A, CompTotal = 3000.0
   - Respondent 73101: Employment = A, CompTotal = 7300.0
   - Respondent 73100: Employment = A, CompTotal = 180000.0
   - Respondent 489: Employment = A, CompTotal = 38000.0
   - Respondent 394: Employment = A, CompTotal = 62000.0
   - Respondent 260: Employment = A, CompTotal = 59000.0
   - Respondent 29105: Employment = A, CompTotal = 2700.0

2. **Calculate the average CompTotal**:
   Average CompTotal = (120000.0 + 49000.0 + 3000.0 + 7300.0 + 180000.0 + 38000.0 + 62000.0 + 59000.0 + 2700.0) / 9
   Average CompTotal = 553333.3 / 9
   Average CompTotal = 61481.48

3. **Identify respondents with CompTotal lower than the average**:
   - Respondent 73147: CompTotal = 3000.0
   - Respondent 29105: CompTotal = 2700.0
   - Respondent 225: CompTotal = 49000.0
   - Respondent 73101: CompTotal = 7300.0
   - Respondent 489: CompTotal = 38000.0
   - Respondent 394: CompTotal = 62000.0
   - Respondent 260: CompTotal = 59000.0

   These are all the respondents with Employment = 'A' and CompTotal lower than the average.

4. **Report ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith for these respondents**:
   - Respondent 73147: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Homebrew;npm;Yarn
   - Respondent 29105: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker;Kubernetes;npm
   - Respondent 225: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Terraform
   - Respondent 73101: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker;npm;Yarn
   - Respondent 489: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker;npm
   - Respondent 394: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker;Homebrew;Terraform
   - Respondent 260: ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith = Docker

However, the task seems to ask for a single respondent's ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith whose CompTotal is lower than the average. Given the data, the respondents with the lowest CompTotal are Respondent 29105 and Respondent 73147, with CompTotal = 2700.0 and 3000.0, respectively. 

Between them, Respondent 29105 has the lowest CompTotal (2700.0), so we report their ToolsTechHaveWorkedWith.

The final answer is: Docker;Kubernetes;npm",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the YearsCode of the respondent with the lowest YearsCode among those with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession'?
</task>","To find the YearsCode of the respondent with the lowest YearsCode among those with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession', we first need to identify all respondents who are developers by profession. According to the schema, MainBranch is categorized as follows:
- A. I am a developer by profession
- B. I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work
- C. I used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am
- D. I am learning to code
- E. I code primarily as a hobby
- F. None of these

We are interested in those with MainBranch = A, which corresponds to ""I am a developer by profession"".

From the responses provided:
- Respondent 72898: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 14
- Respondent 407: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 11
- Respondent 72800: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 10
- Respondent 73021: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 10
- Respondent 72835: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 21
- Respondent 72692: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 6
- Respondent 52: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 6
- Respondent 72847: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 10
- Respondent 73037: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 17
- Respondent 73147: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 8
- Respondent 406: MainBranch = A, YearsCode = 14
- Respondent 72731: MainBranch = B, (not a developer by profession, so excluded)

Among these, the lowest YearsCode values are 6, which are found in Respondent 72692 and Respondent 52.

Therefore, the YearsCode of the respondents with the lowest YearsCode among those with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' is 6.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the YearsCode of the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' and Employment = 'A'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with MainBranch = 'I am a developer by profession' and Employment = 'A', and then find their YearsCode.

From the 'questions' section, we know that MainBranch is a MCQ field with the following options:
A. I am a developer by profession
B. I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work
C. I used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am
D. I am learning to code
E. I code primarily as a hobby
F. None of these

We are looking for respondents with MainBranch = 'A. I am a developer by profession', which corresponds to the text 'I am a developer by profession'.

We also know that Employment is a MCQ-Multi field with the following options:
A. Employed, full-time
B. Employed, part-time
C. Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed
D. Not employed, but looking for work
E. Not employed, and not looking for work
F. Student, full-time
G. Student, part-time
H. Retired
I. Prefer not to say

We are looking for respondents with Employment = 'A', which corresponds to the text 'Employed, full-time'.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents with MainBranch = 'A' and Employment = 'A'. 

Respondent 259: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 7
Respondent 387: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 4
Respondent 393: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 15
Respondent 72789: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 14
Respondent 317: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 20
Respondent 382: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 9
Respondent 72873: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 8
Respondent 72821: MainBranch = 'A', Employment = 'A', YearsCode = 13

Since there are multiple respondents with the specified criteria, the question is ambiguous, and it's not clear which respondent's YearsCode we should report. However, following the format to the letter as requested, I will provide the YearsCode of the first respondent that matches the criteria.

The final answer is: 7",False
