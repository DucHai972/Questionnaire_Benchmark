<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Survey Data
==================================================

Questions:
1. Group: Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]
2. Frequent_Usage: I think that I would like to use this system frequently. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
3. System_Complexity: I found the system unnecessarily complex. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
4. Ease_of_Use: I thought the system was easy to use. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
5. Need_for_Technical_Support: I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
6. Integration_of_Functions: I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
7. Inconsistency: I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
8. Ease_of_Learning: I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
9. Cumbersome_to_Use: I found the system very awkward to use. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
10. Confidence_in_Use: I felt very confident using the system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
11. Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
