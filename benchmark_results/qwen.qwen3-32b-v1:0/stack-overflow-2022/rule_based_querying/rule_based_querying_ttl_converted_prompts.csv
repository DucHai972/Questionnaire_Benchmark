</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500.
</task>","To determine the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500, we need to consider the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields for each respondent. The `CompTotal` represents the total compensation, and `CompFreq` indicates the frequency of the compensation (Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly). We will convert all compensation values to a yearly basis for comparison.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. **Respondent223**:
   - `CompTotal`: 55000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 55000.0 (already yearly)

2. **Respondent73099**:
   - `CompTotal`: 62000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 62000.0

3. **Respondent73050**:
   - `CompTotal`: 65000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 65000.0

4. **Respondent72987**:
   - `CompTotal`: 57000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 57000.0

5. **Respondent72730**:
   - `CompTotal`: 83000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 83000.0

6. **Respondent72825**:
   - `CompTotal`: 80000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 80000.0

7. **Respondent72763**:
   - `CompTotal`: 70000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 70000.0

8. **Respondent286**:
   - `CompTotal`: 42000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 42000.0

9. **Respondent72972**:
   - `CompTotal`: 45000.0
   - `CompFreq`: Yearly
   - Yearly compensation: 45000.0

10. **Respondent73217**:
    - `CompTotal`: 288000.0
    - `CompFreq`: Monthly
    - Yearly compensation: 288000.0 * 12 = 3456000.0

Now, we identify the respondents whose yearly compensation is greater than 63500:

- Respondent72730: 83000.0
- Respondent72825: 80000.0
- Respondent72763: 70000.0
- Respondent73217: 3456000.0

Thus, the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500 are:

**72730, 72825, 72763, 73217**",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 93000, we need to consider the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields for each respondent. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we must convert the compensation to a yearly basis using the following assumptions:

- Weekly → multiply by 52
- Monthly → multiply by 12
- Yearly → use as-is

We will now calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those with a value greater than 93000.

### Calculations:
1. **Respondent255**: `CompTotal` = 98000.0, `CompFreq` = C (Yearly) → 98000.0 ✅

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 164000, we need to consider the ""CompTotal"" and ""CompFreq"" fields for each respondent. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we need to convert the compensation to a yearly basis.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52.
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12.
- **Yearly**: Use the value as is.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Respondent382**:
   - CompTotal: 120000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 120000.0 * 12 = 1,440,000.0 → **Not > 164000**
2. **Respondent72834**:
   - CompTotal: 45000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 45000.0 → **Not > 164000**
3. **Respondent317**:
   - CompTotal: 230000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 230000.0 → **> 164000**
4. **Respondent72970**:
   - CompTotal: 200000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 200000.0 * 12 = 2,400,000.0 → **> 164000**
5. **Respondent72749**:
   - CompTotal: 100000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 100000.0 → **Not > 164000**
6. **Respondent29048**:
   - CompTotal: 1566.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 1566.0 * 12 = 18,792.0 → **Not > 164000**
7. **Respondent72803**:
   - CompTotal: 19000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 19000.0 * 12 = 228,000.0 → **> 164000**
8. **Respondent72825**:
   - CompTotal: 80000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 80000.0 → **Not > 164000**
9. **Respondent103**:
   - CompTotal: 25500.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 25500.0 → **Not > 164000**
10. **Respondent72647**:
    - CompTotal: 60000.0
    - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 60000.0 → **Not > 164000**
11. **Respondent73107**:
    - CompTotal: 300000.0
    - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 300000.0 → **> 164000**
12. **Respondent72815**:
    - CompTotal: 80000.0
    - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
    - Yearly: 80000.0 * 12 = 960,000.0 → **> 164000**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 106500, we need to consider the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields for each respondent. The `CompTotal` field provides the total compensation, and the `CompFreq` field indicates the frequency of the compensation (Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly). We will convert all compensation values to a yearly basis for comparison.

### Step 1: Understand the compensation frequency mapping
From the schema:
- `A. Weekly`
- `B. Monthly`
- `C. Yearly`

### Step 2: Convert compensation to yearly
We will use the following assumptions for conversion:
- Weekly → Yearly: Multiply by 52 (weeks in a year).
- Monthly → Yearly: Multiply by 12 (months in a year).
- Yearly → Yearly: No conversion needed.

### Step 3: Analyze each respondent
We will now calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and compare it to 106500.

1. **Respondent397**
   - `CompTotal`: 6500.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 6500.0 * 12 = 78000.0 → Not greater than 106500

2. **Respondent72826**
   - `CompTotal`: 135000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 135000.0 → Greater than 106500

3. **Respondent73208**
   - `CompTotal`: 3200.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 3200.0 * 12 = 38400.0 → Not greater than 106500

4. **Respondent407**
   - `CompTotal`: 155000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 155000.0 → Greater than 106500

5. **Respondent72594**
   - `CompTotal`: 200000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 200000.0 → Greater than 106500

6. **Respondent363**
   - `CompTotal`: 2260.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 2260.0 * 12 = 27120.0 → Not greater than 106500

7. **Respondent73020**
   - `CompTotal`: 500000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 500000.0 → Greater than 106500

8. **Respondent73021**
   - `CompTotal`: 33400.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 33400.0 → Not greater than 106500

9. **Respondent72872**
   - `CompTotal`: 49500.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 49500.0 → Not greater than 106500

10. **Respondent29031**
    - `CompTotal`: 73500.0
    - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 73500.0 → Not greater than 106500

11. **Respondent404**
    - `CompTotal`: 180000.0
    - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 180000.0 → Greater than 106500

12. **Respondent29124**
    - `CompTotal`: 160000.0
    - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 160000.0 → Greater than 106500

### Step 4: List of respondents with yearly compensation > 106500
The respondents with yearly compensation greater than 106500 are:
- Respondent72826
- Respondent407

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000.
</task>","To determine the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000, we need to consider the `CompTotal`, `CompFreq`, and calculate the yearly compensation accordingly.

### Step-by-step process:
1. **Understand the compensation frequency (`CompFreq`)**:
   - `A. Weekly`: Multiply by 52 to get yearly compensation.
   - `B. Monthly`: Multiply by 12 to get yearly compensation.
   - `C. Yearly`: Use the value as is.

2. **Calculate yearly compensation** for each respondent:
   - For `CompFreq = A`, yearly compensation = `CompTotal * 52`.
   - For `CompFreq = B`, yearly compensation = `CompTotal * 12`.
   - For `CompFreq = C`, yearly compensation = `CompTotal`.

3. **Filter respondents** whose yearly compensation is greater than 220000.

### Calculations:
- **Respondent72877**: `CompTotal = 20000.0`, `CompFreq = B` → `20000.0 * 12 = 240000.0` → ✅
- **Respondent152**: `CompTotal = 140000.0`, `CompFreq = B` → `140000.0 * 12 = 1680000.0` → ✅
- **Respondent260**: `CompTotal = 59000.0`, `CompFreq = C` → `59000.0` → ❌
- **Respondent29106**: `CompTotal = 33000.0`, `CompFreq = B` → `33000.0 * 12 = 396000.0` → ✅
- **Respondent29047**: `CompTotal = 75000.0`, `CompFreq = C` → `75000.0` → ❌
- **Respondent72594**: `CompTotal = 200000.0`, `CompFreq = C` → `200000.0` → ❌
- **Respondent29152**: `CompTotal = 70000.0`, `CompFreq = C` → `70000.0` → ❌
- **Respondent312**: `CompTotal = 120000.0`, `CompFreq = B` → `120000.0 * 12 = 1440000.0` → ✅

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 314000, we need to consider the ""CompTotal"" and ""CompFreq"" fields for each respondent. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we must convert the compensation to a yearly basis using the following assumptions:
- Weekly → multiply by 52
- Monthly → multiply by 12
- Yearly → use as-is

Now, let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent:

1. **Respondent72793**:
   - CompTotal: 110000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 110000.0

2. **Respondent245**:
   - CompTotal: 5500000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 5500000.0

3. **Respondent423**:
   - CompTotal: 2600.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 2600.0 * 12 = 31200.0

4. **Respondent73085**:
   - CompTotal: 4500000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 4500000.0 * 12 = 54000000.0

5. **Respondent72913**:
   - CompTotal: 48000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 48000.0 * 12 = 576000.0

6. **Respondent428**:
   - CompTotal: 11000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 11000.0

7. **Respondent72931**:
   - CompTotal: 11000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 11000.0 * 12 = 132000.0

8. **Respondent73084**:
   - CompTotal: 19000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 19000.0 * 12 = 228000.0

9. **Respondent459**:
   - CompTotal: 400000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 400000.0

10. **Respondent73262**:
    - CompTotal: 850000.0
    - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly Compensation: 850000.0

Now, we identify respondents with yearly compensation greater than 314000:
- Respondent245: 5500000.0
- Respondent73085: 54000000.0
- Respondent72913: 576000.0
- Respondent459: 400000.0
- Respondent73262: 850000.0

**Answer**: 245, 73085, 72913, 459, 73262",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the data**:
   - The `EdLevel` field is a multiple-choice question with options labeled A to I.
   - The `CompTotal` field is an open-ended question representing the total compensation.
   - The `CompFreq` field is a multiple-choice question indicating the frequency of compensation (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).

2. **Group respondents by `EdLevel`**:
   - For each `EdLevel`, calculate the average yearly compensation.
   - Adjust the `CompTotal` values to yearly compensation if they are not already in yearly terms.

3. **Identify respondents whose compensation is more than double the average for their `EdLevel`**.

4. **Output the list of such respondents**.

---

### Step 1: Adjust `CompTotal` to Yearly Compensation

We need to convert `CompTotal` to yearly compensation based on the `CompFreq` field:
- If `CompFreq` is ""Weekly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 52.
- If `CompFreq` is ""Monthly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 12.
- If `CompFreq` is ""Yearly"", use `CompTotal` as is.

---

### Step 2: Group by `EdLevel` and Calculate Averages

We will calculate the average yearly compensation for each `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Compensation > 2 × Average

We will compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their `EdLevel` and identify those with compensation more than double the average.

---

### Final Answer

After performing the above steps, the respondents with a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their `EdLevel` are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the data**:
   - `EdLevel` is a multiple-choice question with levels from A to I.
   - `CompTotal` is the total compensation provided by the respondent.
   - `CompFreq` indicates the frequency of the compensation (Yearly, Monthly, or Weekly).
   - We need to normalize all compensation to a yearly basis for comparison.

2. **Normalize compensation**:
   - If `CompFreq` is ""Yearly"", the value in `CompTotal` is already yearly.
   - If `CompFreq` is ""Monthly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 12 to get the yearly compensation.
   - If `CompFreq` is ""Weekly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 52 to get the yearly compensation.

3. **Group by `EdLevel` and calculate the average yearly compensation** for each group.

4. **Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average** for their `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 1: Normalize compensation

| Respondent ID | CompTotal | CompFreq | Yearly Compensation |
|---------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| 73030         | 1600000.0 | C        | 1600000.0           |
| 440           | 45000.0   | C        | 45000.0             |
| 73148         | 124800.0  | C        | 124800.0            |
| 72753         | 24000.0   | C        | 24000.0             |
| 72916         | 110000.0  | C        | 110000.0            |
| 423           | 2600.0    | B        | 31200.0             |
| 297           | 33000.0   | B        | 396000.0            |
| 72965         | 50000.0   | C        | 50000.0             |
| 261           | 600000.0  | C        | 600000.0            |

---

### Step 2: Group by `EdLevel` and calculate average yearly compensation

All respondents have `EdLevel` = ""A"" (Primary/elementary school). So we calculate the average yearly compensation for this group.

**Average yearly compensation for EdLevel A**:
$$
\frac{1600000.0 + 45000.0 + 124800.0 + 24000.0 + 110000.0 + 31200.0 + 396000.0 + 50000.0 + 600000.0}{9} = \frac{2921000.0}{9} \approx 324555.56
$$

---

### Step 3: Identify respondents with compensation more than double the average

Double the average = $ 2 \times 324555.56 = 649111.12 $

Respondents with yearly compensation > 649111.12:
- 73030: 1600000.0
- 297: 396000.0 (not more than 649111.12)
- 261: 600000.0 (not more than 649111.12)

Only **Respondent73030** has a yearly compensation more than double the average for their `EdLevel`.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Identify the highest `YearsCode` for each `EdLevel`.
2. Calculate 25% of that highest value.
3. Find all respondents whose `YearsCode` is within 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for their `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 1: Group by `EdLevel` and find the highest `YearsCode`

From the data, the `EdLevel` values and their corresponding `YearsCode` are:

- **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)**:
  - Respondents: 72681 (20), 29157 (29), 73100 (10), 412 (11), 72647 (5), 63 (30), 184 (2), 73191 (11), 529 (4), 72664 (25)
  - Highest `YearsCode`: 30

- **EdLevel D (Associate degree)**:
  - Respondents: 529 (4)
  - Highest `YearsCode`: 4

- **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)**:
  - Respondents: 73191 (11)
  - Highest `YearsCode`: 11

---

### Step 2: Calculate 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for each `EdLevel`

- **EdLevel A**: 25% of 30 = 7.5
- **EdLevel D**: 25% of 4 = 1
- **EdLevel C**: 25% of 11 = 2.75

---

### Step 3: Find respondents whose `YearsCode` is within 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for their `EdLevel`

- **EdLevel A** (within 7.5 of 30):
  - Respondents with `YearsCode` between 22.5 and 30:
    - 29157 (29), 63 (30), 72664 (25)

- **EdLevel D** (within 1 of 4):
  - Respondents with `YearsCode` between 3 and 5:
    - 529 (4)

- **EdLevel C** (within 2.75 of 11):
  - Respondents with `YearsCode` between 8.25 and 13.75:
    - 73191 (11)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average 'YearsCodePro' for their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `EdLevel`.
2. Calculate the average `YearsCodePro` for each `EdLevel`.
3. Identify respondents whose `YearsCodePro` is greater than the average for their `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 1: Group by `EdLevel` and calculate average `YearsCodePro`

#### Group 1: `EdLevel = A (Primary/elementary school)`
Respondents:
- Respondent326: 3
- Respondent361: 8
- Respondent133: 2
- Respondent72776: 5
- Respondent73101: 8

Average = (3 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 8) / 5 = 26 / 5 = **5.2**

Respondents with `YearsCodePro > 5.2`:
- Respondent361 (8)
- Respondent73101 (8)

#### Group 2: `EdLevel = B (Secondary school)`
Respondents:
- Respondent127: 7
- Respondent72634: 14

Average = (7 + 14) / 2 = 21 / 2 = **10.5**

Respondents with `YearsCodePro > 10.5`:
- Respondent72634 (14)

#### Group 3: `EdLevel = C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)`
Respondents:
- Respondent72761: 14

Average = 14

Respondents with `YearsCodePro > 14`: None

#### Group 4: `EdLevel = E (Bachelor's degree)`
Respondents:
- Respondent73217: 14
- Respondent469: 8
- Respondent393: 11

Average = (14 + 8 + 11) / 3 = 33 / 3 = **11**

Respondents with `YearsCodePro > 11`:
- Respondent73217 (14)

---

### Final Answer:
**361, 73101, 72634, 73217**",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Identify the highest `CompTotal` for each country.
2. Determine which respondents have a `CompTotal` within 10% of the highest in their respective country.
3. List the IDs of these respondents.

### Step 1: Group by Country and Find Maximum `CompTotal`
From the data, the countries and their highest `CompTotal` are:

- **India**: 3,200,000.0 and 2,800,000.0 → **3,200,000.0**
- **Canada**: 88,000.0
- **United States of America**: 109,000.0
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**: 42,000.0 and 15,000.0 → **42,000.0**
- **Netherlands**: 4,000.0
- **Germany**: 67,000.0
- **Lithuania**: 7,300.0
- **Czech Republic**: 120,000.0
- **Israel**: 360,000.0

### Step 2: Identify Respondents Within 10% of the Maximum in Their Country

- **India** (Max: 3,200,000.0):  
  - Respondent395 (3,200,000.0) → within 10% ✅  
  - Respondent486 (2,800,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **Canada** (Max: 88,000.0):  
  - Respondent72710 (88,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **United States of America** (Max: 109,000.0):  
  - Respondent52 (109,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland** (Max: 42,000.0):  
  - Respondent73069 (42,000.0) → within 10% ✅  
  - Respondent229 (15,000.0) → not within 10% ❌  

- **Netherlands** (Max: 4,000.0):  
  - Respondent203 (4,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **Germany** (Max: 67,000.0):  
  - Respondent29071 (67,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **Lithuania** (Max: 7,300.0):  
  - Respondent73101 (7,300.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **Czech Republic** (Max: 120,000.0):  
  - Respondent382 (120,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

- **Israel** (Max: 360,000.0):  
  - Respondent72927 (360,000.0) → within 10% ✅  

### Final List of Respondents

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Group respondents by their education level (EdLevel).**
2. **Calculate the average yearly compensation (CompTotal) for each group.**
3. **Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.**
4. **List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their group.**

---

### Step 1: Group by Education Level and Calculate Averages

From the data, the education levels (EdLevel) and their corresponding yearly compensation (CompTotal) are:

#### Education Level A (Primary/elementary school):
- Respondent486: 2,800,000.0
- Respondent123: 12,000.0
- Respondent547: 300,000,000.0
- Respondent134: 7,200.0
- Respondent72746: 439,000.0
- Respondent72739: 180,000.0
- Respondent300: 1,000,000.0
- Respondent479: 12,000.0
- Respondent162: 100,000.0

**Average for EdLevel A:**
$$
(2,800,000 + 12,000 + 300,000,000 + 7,200 + 439,000 + 180,000 + 1,000,000 + 12,000 + 100,000) / 9 = 34,464,400.0
$$

#### Education Level B (Secondary school):
- Respondent72731: 280,000.0
- Respondent396: 100,000.0

**Average for EdLevel B:**
$$
(280,000 + 100,000) / 2 = 190,000.0
$$

#### Education Level C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
- Respondent72746: 439,000.0

**Average for EdLevel C:**
$$
439,000.0
$$

---

### Step 2: Compare Each Respondent's Compensation to the Average for Their Education Level

#### Respondent486 (EdLevel A, 2,800,000.0):
- 2,800,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent123 (EdLevel A, 12,000.0):
- 12,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent547 (EdLevel A, 300,000,000.0):
- 300,000,000.0 > 34,464,400.0 → **Yes**

#### Respondent134 (EdLevel A, 7,200.0):
- 7,200.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent72746 (EdLevel C, 439,000.0):
- 439,000.0 = 439,000.0 → **No**

#### Respondent72739 (EdLevel A, 180,000.0):
- 180,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent300 (EdLevel A, 1,000,000.0):
- 1,000,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent479 (EdLevel A, 12,000.0):
- 12,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

#### Respondent72731 (EdLevel B, 280,000.0):
- 280,000.0 > 190,000.0 → **Yes**

#### Respondent396 (EdLevel B, 100,000.0):
- 100,000.0 < 190,000.0 → **No**

#### Respondent162 (EdLevel A, 100,000.0):
- 100,000.0 < 34,464,400.0 → **No**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Group respondents by their EdLevel.**
2. **Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.**
3. **Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.**

### Step 1: Group respondents by EdLevel
From the data, we have the following EdLevels:
- ""A. Primary/elementary school""
- ""C. Some college/university study without earning a degree""

These are the only two EdLevels represented in the dataset.

### Step 2: Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel
We will calculate the average of the `CompTotal` values for each group.

#### EdLevel ""A. Primary/elementary school""
Respondents:
- Respondent72664: 150000.0
- Respondent29115: 2000000.0
- Respondent72969: 147000.0
- Respondent72728: 200000.0
- Respondent392: 60000.0
- Respondent73047: 90000.0
- Respondent72813: 150000.0
- Respondent72867: 8000.0
- Respondent223: 55000.0

Average:
$$
\frac{150000.0 + 2000000.0 + 147000.0 + 200000.0 + 60000.0 + 90000.0 + 150000.0 + 8000.0 + 55000.0}{9} = \frac{2950000.0}{9} \approx 327777.78
$$

#### EdLevel ""C. Some college/university study without earning a degree""
Respondents:
- Respondent72799: 90000.0
- Respondent211: 207000.0

Average:
$$
\frac{90000.0 + 207000.0}{2} = \frac{297000.0}{2} = 148500.0
$$

### Step 3: Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel
#### EdLevel ""A. Primary/elementary school""
Double the average: $ 327777.78 \times 2 = 655555.56 $
Respondents with compensation > 655555.56:
- Respondent29115: 2000000.0

#### EdLevel ""C. Some college/university study without earning a degree""
Double the average: $ 148500.0 \times 2 = 297000.0 $
Respondents with compensation > 297000.0:
- Respondent211: 207000.0 (This is not more than 297000.0)

### Final Answer

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, we will:

1. Identify the education level (EdLevel) for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level.
3. Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.
4. List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Step 1: Group respondents by education level and calculate average compensation
From the data, the education levels and their corresponding respondents are:

- **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)**:
  - Respondent492: 33000.0
  - Respondent73010: 3200.0
  - Respondent72735: 73000.0
  - Respondent73150: 350000.0
  - Respondent486: 2800000.0
  - Respondent72958: 44000.0
  - **Average**: (33000.0 + 3200.0 + 73000.0 + 350000.0 + 2800000.0 + 44000.0) / 6 = 590,500.0

- **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)**:
  - Respondent448: 10000000.0
  - **Average**: 10,000,000.0

- **EdLevel D (Associate degree)**:
  - Respondent529: 60000.0
  - **Average**: 60,000.0

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level
- **Respondent492 (EdLevel A)**: 33000.0 < 590500.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent73010 (EdLevel A)**: 3200.0 < 590500.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent72735 (EdLevel A)**: 73000.0 < 590500.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent73150 (EdLevel A)**: 350000.0 < 590500.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent486 (EdLevel A)**: 2800000.0 > 590500.0 → Higher
- **Respondent72958 (EdLevel A)**: 44000.0 < 590500.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent448 (EdLevel C)**: 10000000.0 > 10000000.0 → Not higher
- **Respondent529 (EdLevel D)**: 60000.0 = 60000.0 → Not higher

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, we will:

1. Identify the education level (EdLevel) for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average yearly compensation (CompTotal) for each education level.
3. Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.
4. List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Step 1: Group respondents by education level and calculate average yearly compensation
#### Education Level A (Primary/elementary school):
- Respondents: 306, 72784, 547, 123, 113
- Yearly compensation (CompTotal): 55000.0, 80000.0, 300000000.0, 12000.0, 70000.0
- Average: (55000.0 + 80000.0 + 300000000.0 + 12000.0 + 70000.0) / 5 = 60,374,000.0

#### Education Level B (Secondary school):
- Respondents: 238
- Yearly compensation (CompTotal): 36000.0
- Average: 36000.0

#### Education Level C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
- Respondents: 72669, 72659
- Yearly compensation (CompTotal): 67000.0, 21000.0
- Average: (67000.0 + 21000.0) / 2 = 44000.0

#### Education Level D (Associate degree):
- Respondents: 115
- Yearly compensation (CompTotal): 150000.0
- Average: 150000.0

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level
#### Education Level A:
- Respondent 306: 55000.0 < 60,374,000.0 → Not higher
- Respondent 72784: 80000.0 < 60,374,000.0 → Not higher
- Respondent 547: 300000000.0 > 60,374,000.0 → Higher
- Respondent 123: 12000.0 < 60,374,000.0 → Not higher
- Respondent 113: 70000.0 < 60,374,000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level B:
- Respondent 238: 36000.0 = 36000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level C:
- Respondent 72669: 67000.0 > 44000.0 → Higher
- Respondent 72659: 21000.0 < 44000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level D:
- Respondent 115: 150000.0 = 150000.0 → Not higher

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the data**:
   - The `EdLevel` field is a multiple-choice question with options from A to I.
   - The `CompTotal` field is an open-ended question representing the total compensation.
   - The `CompFreq` field is a multiple-choice question indicating the compensation frequency (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).

2. **Group respondents by `EdLevel`**:
   - For each `EdLevel`, calculate the average yearly compensation.
   - Convert `CompTotal` to yearly compensation if it is not already in yearly terms.

3. **Identify respondents whose compensation is more than double the average for their `EdLevel`**.

4. **Output the list of such respondents**.

---

### Step 1: Convert `CompTotal` to Yearly Compensation

- If `CompFreq` is ""Yearly"", the value in `CompTotal` is already in yearly terms.
- If `CompFreq` is ""Monthly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 12 to get the yearly compensation.
- If `CompFreq` is ""Weekly"", multiply `CompTotal` by 52 to get the yearly compensation.

---

### Step 2: Group by `EdLevel` and Calculate Averages

We will calculate the average yearly compensation for each `EdLevel` group.

---

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Compensation > 2 × Average

We will compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their `EdLevel` and identify those with compensation more than double the average.

---

### Step 4: Output the List of Respondents

After performing the above steps, the respondents who have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their `EdLevel` are:

**['29141', '72681', '72793', '240']**",False
