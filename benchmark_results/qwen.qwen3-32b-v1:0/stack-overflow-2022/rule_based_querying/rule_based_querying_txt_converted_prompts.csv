</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 63500.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 63500, we need to consider the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields for each respondent. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly"", we must convert it to an annual value.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52.
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12.
- **Yearly**: Use the value as is.

### Calculations:
1. **Respondent 223**: `CompTotal = 55000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 55000.0
2. **Respondent 73099**: `CompTotal = 62000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 62000.0
3. **Respondent 73050**: `CompTotal = 65000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 65000.0
4. **Respondent 72987**: `CompTotal = 57000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 57000.0
5. **Respondent 72730**: `CompTotal = 83000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 83000.0
6. **Respondent 72825**: `CompTotal = 80000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 80000.0
7. **Respondent 72763**: `CompTotal = 70000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 70000.0
8. **Respondent 286**: `CompTotal = 42000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 42000.0
9. **Respondent 72972**: `CompTotal = 45000.0`, `CompFreq = C (Yearly)` → 45000.0
10. **Respondent 73217**: `CompTotal = 288000.0`, `CompFreq = B (Monthly)` → 288000.0 * 12 = 3456000.0

### Respondents with yearly compensation > 63500:
- **73050** (65000.0)
- **72730** (83000.0)
- **72825** (80000.0)
- **72763** (70000.0)
- **73217** (3456000.0)

### Final Answer:
73050, 72730, 72825, 72763, 73217",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 93000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 93000, we need to consider both the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we must convert it to a yearly equivalent.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52.
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12.
- **Yearly**: Use the value as is.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Respondent 255**:

   - Yearly Compensation: 124800.0 ✅

7. **Respondent 72904**:
   - CompTotal: 4500.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 4500.0 * 12 = 54000.0 ❌

8. **Respondent 338**:
   - CompTotal: 24500.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 24500.0 * 12 = 294000.0 ✅

9. **Respondent 461**:
   - CompTotal: 2900.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 2900.0 * 12 = 34800.0 ❌

10. **Respondent 73196**:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 164000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 164000, we need to consider both the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields. If the compensation frequency is not yearly, we must convert it to a yearly basis for comparison.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52.
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12.
- **Yearly**: Use the value as-is.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Respondent 382**:
   - `CompTotal`: 120000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 120000.0 * 12 = 1,440,000.0 → **Eligible**

2. **Respondent 72834**:
   - `CompTotal`: 45000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 45000.0 → **Not Eligible**

3. **Respondent 317**:
   - `CompTotal`: 230000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 230000.0 → **Eligible**

4. **Respondent 72970**:
   - `CompTotal`: 200000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 200000.0 * 12 = 2,400,000.0 → **Eligible**

5. **Respondent 72749**:
   - `CompTotal`: 100000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 100000.0 → **Not Eligible**

6. **Respondent 29048**:
   - `CompTotal`: 1566.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 1566.0 * 12 = 18,792.0 → **Not Eligible**

7. **Respondent 72803**:
   - `CompTotal`: 19000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 19000.0 * 12 = 228,000.0 → **Eligible**

8. **Respondent 72825**:
   - `CompTotal`: 80000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 80000.0 → **Not Eligible**

9. **Respondent 103**:
   - `CompTotal`: 25500.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 25500.0 → **Not Eligible**

10. **Respondent 72647**:
    - `CompTotal`: 60000.0
    - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 60000.0 → **Not Eligible**

11. **Respondent 73107**:
    - `CompTotal`: 300000.0
    - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly: 300000.0 → **Eligible**

12. **Respondent 72815**:
    - `CompTotal`: 80000.0
    - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
    - Yearly: 80000.0 * 12 = 960,000.0 → **Eligible**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 106500.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 106500, we need to consider both the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields for each respondent. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we must convert the compensation to a yearly basis using the following assumptions:

- Weekly → multiply by 52
- Monthly → multiply by 12
- Yearly → use as-is

Now, let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent and identify those with a value greater than 106500.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000.
</task>","To determine the respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 220000, we need to consider the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly,"" we must convert the compensation to a yearly basis.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52.
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12.
- **Yearly**: Use the value as-is.

### Analysis:
1. **Respondent 72877**:
   - `CompTotal`: 20000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 20000.0 * 12 = 240000.0 → **Eligible**

2. **Respondent 152**:
   - `CompTotal`: 140000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 140000.0 * 12 = 1680000.0 → **Eligible**

3. **Respondent 260**:
   - `CompTotal`: 59000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 59000.0 → **Not Eligible**

4. **Respondent 29106**:
   - `CompTotal`: 33000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 33000.0 * 12 = 396000.0 → **Eligible**

5. **Respondent 29047**:
   - `CompTotal`: 75000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 75000.0 → **Not Eligible**

6. **Respondent 72594**:
   - `CompTotal`: 200000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 200000.0 → **Not Eligible**

7. **Respondent 29152**:
   - `CompTotal`: 70000.0
   - `CompFreq`: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly: 70000.0 → **Not Eligible**

8. **Respondent 312**:
   - `CompTotal`: 120000.0
   - `CompFreq`: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly: 120000.0 * 12 = 1440000.0 → **Eligible**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated yearly compensation is greater than 314000.
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation greater than 314000, we need to consider both the `CompTotal` and `CompFreq` fields. If the compensation frequency is not ""Yearly"", we must convert it to an annual value.

### Conversion Rules:
- **Weekly**: Multiply by 52
- **Monthly**: Multiply by 12
- **Yearly**: Use as-is

### Calculations:
1. **Respondent 72793**:
   - CompTotal: 110000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 110000.0

2. **Respondent 245**:
   - CompTotal: 5500000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 5500000.0

3. **Respondent 423**:
   - CompTotal: 2600.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 2600.0 * 12 = 31200.0

4. **Respondent 73085**:
   - CompTotal: 4500000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 4500000.0 * 12 = 54000000.0

5. **Respondent 72913**:
   - CompTotal: 48000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 48000.0 * 12 = 576000.0

6. **Respondent 428**:
   - CompTotal: 11000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 11000.0

7. **Respondent 72931**:
   - CompTotal: 11000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 11000.0 * 12 = 132000.0

8. **Respondent 73084**:
   - CompTotal: 19000.0
   - CompFreq: B (Monthly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 19000.0 * 12 = 228000.0

9. **Respondent 459**:
   - CompTotal: 400000.0
   - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
   - Yearly Compensation: 400000.0

10. **Respondent 73262**:
    - CompTotal: 850000.0
    - CompFreq: C (Yearly)
    - Yearly Compensation: 850000.0

### Respondents with Yearly Compensation > 314000:
- **Respondent 245**: 5500000.0
- **Respondent 73085**: 54000000.0
- **Respondent 72913**: 576000.0
- **Respondent 459**: 400000.0
- **Respondent 73262**: 850000.0

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Group respondents by their EdLevel.**
2. **Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.**
3. **For each respondent, calculate their yearly compensation (if not already yearly).**
4. **Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to double the average for their EdLevel.**

---

### Step 1: Group respondents by EdLevel

From the data, the EdLevel values are:
- A. Primary/elementary school
- C. Some college/university study without earning a degree
- D. Associate degree (A.A., A.S., etc.)
- H. Other doctoral degree (Ph.D., Ed.D., etc.)

We will calculate the average yearly compensation for each of these groups.

---

### Step 2: Calculate yearly compensation for each respondent

We need to convert compensation to yearly if it's not already. The CompFreq field tells us the frequency:
- A. Weekly
- B. Monthly
- C. Yearly

We will convert:
- Weekly to yearly: multiply by 52
- Monthly to yearly: multiply by 12
- Yearly: use as is

---

### Step 3: Calculate average yearly compensation per EdLevel

We will calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel group.

---

### Step 4: Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to double the average for their EdLevel

We will identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.

---

### Calculations

#### Group 1: EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)
Respondents:
- 133: CompTotal = 1680.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 1680 * 12 = 20160
- 189: CompTotal = 100000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly) → 100000
- 365: CompTotal = 52000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 52000 * 12 = 624000
- 508: CompTotal = 800000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 800000 * 12 = 9600000
- 72802: CompTotal = 7200.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 7200 * 12 = 86400

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel A:
$$
(20160 + 100000 + 624000 + 9600000 + 86400) / 5 = 2065280
$$

Double the average: 2065280 * 2 = 4130560

Respondents with yearly compensation > 4130560:
- 508: 9600000

#### Group 2: EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)
Respondents:
- 189: Already included in EdLevel A
- 242: CompTotal = 250000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly) → 250000
- 397: CompTotal = 6500.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 6500 * 12 = 78000

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel C:
$$
(250000 + 78000) / 2 = 164000
$$

Double the average: 164000 * 2 = 328000

Respondents with yearly compensation > 328000:
- 242: 250000 (not more than 328000)

#### Group 3: EdLevel D (Associate degree)
Respondent:
- 364: CompTotal = 46000.0, CompFreq = B (Monthly) → 46000 * 12 = 552000

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel D:
$$
552000
$$

Double the average: 552000 * 2 = 1104000

Respondents with yearly compensation > 1104000:
- None

#### Group 4: EdLevel H (Other doctoral degree)
Respondent:
- 73087: CompTotal = 125000.0, CompFreq = C (Yearly) → 125000

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel H:
$$
125000
$$

Double the average: 125000 * 2 = 250000

Respondents with yearly compensation > 250000:
- None

---

### Final Answer

The only respondent whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we first need to calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel category. Then, we identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their respective EdLevel.

### Step 1: Group respondents by EdLevel and calculate the average yearly compensation for each group.
From the data provided, all respondents have the same EdLevel: ""A. Primary/elementary school.""

Respondents:
- 73030: 1600000.0
- 440: 45000.0
- 73148: 124800.0
- 72753: 24000.0
- 72916: 110000.0
- 423: 2600.0
- 297: 33000.0
- 72965: 50000.0
- 261: 600000.0

Average yearly compensation for EdLevel ""A"":
$$
\frac{1600000.0 + 45000.0 + 124800.0 + 24000.0 + 110000.0 + 2600.0 + 33000.0 + 50000.0 + 600000.0}{9} = \frac{2534400.0}{9} = 281600.0
$$

Double the average: $ 281600.0 \times 2 = 563200.0 $

### Step 2: Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average.
Respondents with yearly compensation > 563200.0:
- 73030: 1600000.0
- 261: 600000.0

### Final Answer:
73030, 261",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'YearsCode' is within 25% of the highest 'YearsCode' in their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this, we need to:

1. Identify the highest `YearsCode` for each `EdLevel`.
2. Calculate 25% of that highest value.
3. Find all respondents whose `YearsCode` is within 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for their `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 1: Group by `EdLevel` and find the highest `YearsCode` for each

From the data:

- **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)**:
  - Respondents: 72681 (20), 29157 (29), 73100 (10), 412 (11), 72647 (5), 184 (2), 73191 (11), 529 (4), 72664 (25)
  - Highest `YearsCode`: 29

- **EdLevel B (Secondary school)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)**:
  - Respondents: 73191 (11)
  - Highest `YearsCode`: 11

- **EdLevel D (Associate degree)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel E (Bachelor's degree)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel F (Master's degree)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel G (Professional degree)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel H (Other doctoral degree)**: No respondents in the data.

- **EdLevel I (Something else)**: No respondents in the data.

---

### Step 2: Calculate 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for each `EdLevel`

- **EdLevel A**: 25% of 29 = 7.25
- **EdLevel C**: 25% of 11 = 2.75

---

### Step 3: Find respondents whose `YearsCode` is within 25% of the highest `YearsCode` for their `EdLevel`

- **EdLevel A**:
  - Respondents with `YearsCode` between 21.75 (29 - 7.25) and 29:
    - 72681 (20) → Not within range
    - 29157 (29) → Within range
    - 73100 (10) → Not within range
    - 412 (11) → Not within range
    - 72647 (5) → Not within range
    - 184 (2) → Not within range
    - 73191 (11) → Not within range
    - 529 (4) → Not within range
    - 72664 (25) → Within range

- **EdLevel C**:
  - Respondents with `YearsCode` between 8.25 (11 - 2.75) and 11:
    - 73191 (11) → Within range

---

### Final Answer

Respondents whose `YearsCode` is within 25% of the highest `YearsCode` in their `EdLevel`:

**29157, 72664, 73191**",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'YearsCodePro' is greater than the average 'YearsCodePro' for their edlevel.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average `YearsCodePro` for each `EdLevel`.
2. Identify respondents whose `YearsCodePro` is greater than the average for their `EdLevel`.

---

### Step 1: Group by `EdLevel` and calculate average `YearsCodePro`

From the data:

- **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)**:
  - Respondents: 326, 133, 72776
  - `YearsCodePro`: 3, 2, 5
  - Average: (3 + 2 + 5) / 3 = 3.33

- **EdLevel B (Secondary school)**:
  - Respondents: 127, 72634
  - `YearsCodePro`: 7, 14
  - Average: (7 + 14) / 2 = 10.5

- **EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)**:
  - Respondents: 72761
  - `YearsCodePro`: 14
  - Average: 14

- **EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school)** appears again for respondent 361, but the `EdLevel` is listed as A, so it's included in the same group.

---

### Step 2: Identify respondents whose `YearsCodePro` is greater than the average for their `EdLevel`

- **EdLevel A (3.33)**:
  - 326: 3 → Not greater
  - 133: 2 → Not greater
  - 72776: 5 → Greater
  - 361: 8 → Greater

- **EdLevel B (10.5)**:
  - 127: 7 → Not greater
  - 72634: 14 → Greater

- **EdLevel C (14)**:
  - 72761: 14 → Not greater (equal to average)

---

### Final Answer:

['72776', '361', '72634']",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'CompTotal' is within 10% of the highest 'CompTotal' in their country.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Identify the highest 'CompTotal' for each country.
2. Determine which respondents have a 'CompTotal' within 10% of the highest in their respective country.

### Step 1: Group by Country and Find Maximum 'CompTotal'
From the data, the countries and their highest 'CompTotal' are:

- **India**: 3,200,000.0 (Respondent 395) and 2,800,000.0 (Respondent 486) → Max = 3,200,000.0
- **Canada**: 88,000.0 (Respondent 72710)
- **United States of America**: 109,000.0 (Respondent 52)
- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**: 15,000.0 (Respondent 229) and 42,000.0 (Respondent 73069) → Max = 42,000.0
- **Netherlands**: 4,000.0 (Respondent 203)
- **Germany**: 67,000.0 (Respondent 29071)
- **Lithuania**: 7,300.0 (Respondent 73101)
- **Czech Republic**: 120,000.0 (Respondent 382)
- **Israel**: 360,000.0 (Respondent 72927)

### Step 2: Identify Respondents Within 10% of the Maximum in Their Country

- **India** (Max = 3,200,000.0): 10% = 320,000.0 → Range: 2,880,000.0 to 3,200,000.0
  - Respondent 395: 3,200,000.0 ✅
  - Respondent 486: 2,800,000.0 ❌

- **Canada** (Max = 88,000.0): 10% = 8,800.0 → Range: 79,200.0 to 88,000.0
  - Respondent 72710: 88,000.0 ✅

- **United States of America** (Max = 109,000.0): 10% = 10,900.0 → Range: 98,100.0 to 109,000.0
  - Respondent 52: 109,000.0 ✅

- **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland** (Max = 42,000.0): 10% = 4,200.0 → Range: 37,800.0 to 42,000.0
  - Respondent 229: 15,000.0 ❌
  - Respondent 73069: 42,000.0 ✅

- **Netherlands** (Max = 4,000.0): 10% = 400.0 → Range: 3,600.0 to 4,000.0
  - Respondent 203: 4,000.0 ✅

- **Germany** (Max = 67,000.0): 10% = 6,700.0 → Range: 60,300.0 to 67,000.0
  - Respondent 29071: 67,000.0 ✅

- **Lithuania** (Max = 7,300.0): 10% = 730.0 → Range: 6,570.0 to 7,300.0
  - Respondent 73101: 7,300.0 ✅

- **Czech Republic** (Max = 120,000.0): 10% = 12,000.0 → Range: 108,000.0 to 120,000.0
  - Respondent 382: 120,000.0 ✅

- **Israel** (Max = 360,000.0): 10% = 36,000.0 → Range: 324,000.0 to 360,000.0
  - Respondent 72927: 360,000.0 ✅

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, I will:

1. Identify the education level (EdLevel) for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average yearly compensation (CompTotal) for each education level.
3. Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.
4. List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Step 1: Group respondents by education level and calculate average yearly compensation
#### Education Level A (Primary/elementary school)
Respondents: 486, 123, 547, 134, 300, 479, 162  
CompTotal: 2800000.0, 12000.0, 300000000.0, 7200.0, 1000000.0, 12000.0, 100000.0  
Average: (2800000.0 + 12000.0 + 300000000.0 + 7200.0 + 1000000.0 + 12000.0 + 100000.0) / 7 = 43,450,857.14

#### Education Level B (Secondary school)
Respondent: 72731  
CompTotal: 280000.0  
Average: 280000.0

#### Education Level C (Some college/university study without earning a degree)
Respondent: 72746  
CompTotal: 439000.0  
Average: 439000.0

#### Education Level B (Secondary school) again for Respondent 396
Respondent: 396  
CompTotal: 100000.0  
Average for Education Level B: (280000.0 + 100000.0) / 2 = 190000.0

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level
#### Education Level A
Respondents with CompTotal > 43,450,857.14: 547 (300,000,000.0)

#### Education Level B
Respondents with CompTotal > 190000.0: None

#### Education Level C
Respondents with CompTotal > 439000.0: None

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Group respondents by their EdLevel.**
2. **Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.**
3. **Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.**

### Step 1: Group respondents by EdLevel and calculate average compensation
From the data, we have the following EdLevels and their corresponding respondents:

#### EdLevel A (Primary/elementary school):
- Respondent 72664: 150000.0
- Respondent 29115: 2000000.0
- Respondent 72969: 147000.0
- Respondent 72728: 200000.0
- Respondent 392: 60000.0
- Respondent 73047: 90000.0
- Respondent 72867: 8000.0
- Respondent 223: 55000.0

Average for EdLevel A:
$$
\frac{150000.0 + 2000000.0 + 147000.0 + 200000.0 + 60000.0 + 90000.0 + 8000.0 + 55000.0}{8} = \frac{2700000.0}{8} = 337500.0
$$

#### EdLevel C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
- Respondent 72799: 90000.0
- Respondent 211: 207000.0

Average for EdLevel C:
$$
\frac{90000.0 + 207000.0}{2} = \frac{297000.0}{2} = 148500.0
$$

### Step 2: Identify respondents with compensation more than double the average for their EdLevel

#### EdLevel A (Double the average = 675000.0):
- Respondent 29115: 2000000.0 (more than 675000.0)

#### EdLevel C (Double the average = 297000.0):
- Respondent 211: 207000.0 (less than 297000.0)
- Respondent 72799: 90000.0 (less than 297000.0)

### Final Answer:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, I will:

1. Identify the education level (EdLevel) for each respondent.
2. Convert the compensation (CompTotal) to yearly compensation if it's not already in yearly terms.
3. Calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level.
4. Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.
5. List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Step 1: Identify Education Levels and Yearly Compensation
From the data, the education levels (EdLevel) are:
- A. Primary/elementary school
- D. Associate degree (A.A., A.S., etc.)
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 492)
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 73010)
- C. Some college/university study without earning a degree
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 72735)
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 73150)
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 486)
- A. Primary/elementary school (again for Respondent 72958)

We will group respondents by their education level and calculate the average yearly compensation for each group.

### Step 2: Convert Compensation to Yearly
For each respondent, if the compensation frequency (CompFreq) is not ""Yearly"", we will convert it to yearly compensation:
- Weekly: Multiply by 52
- Monthly: Multiply by 12

### Step 3: Calculate Average Yearly Compensation for Each Education Level
We will calculate the average yearly compensation for each education level.

### Step 4: Compare Each Respondent's Compensation to the Average
We will compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.

### Step 5: List the Respondents
We will list the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Final Answer
After performing the above steps, the respondents with a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level are:

**486, 72735, 72958**",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a yearly compensation that is higher than the average yearly compensation for all respondents with the same education level?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a yearly compensation higher than the average for their education level, I will:

1. Identify the education level (EdLevel) for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average yearly compensation (CompTotal) for each education level.
3. Compare each respondent's yearly compensation to the average for their education level.
4. List the respondents whose compensation is higher than the average for their education level.

### Step 1: Group respondents by education level and calculate average compensation
#### Education Level A (Primary/elementary school):
- Respondents: 72784, 547, 123
- CompTotal: 80000.0, 300000000.0, 12000.0
- Average: (80000.0 + 300000000.0 + 12000.0) / 3 = 100040000.0

#### Education Level B (Secondary school):
- Respondent: 238
- CompTotal: 36000.0
- Average: 36000.0

#### Education Level C (Some college/university study without earning a degree):
- Respondents: 306, 72659
- CompTotal: 55000.0, 21000.0
- Average: (55000.0 + 21000.0) / 2 = 38000.0

#### Education Level D (Associate degree):
- Respondent: 115
- CompTotal: 150000.0
- Average: 150000.0

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's compensation to the average for their education level
#### Education Level A:
- 72784: 80000.0 < 100040000.0 → Not higher
- 547: 300000000.0 > 100040000.0 → Higher
- 123: 12000.0 < 100040000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level B:
- 238: 36000.0 = 36000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level C:
- 306: 55000.0 > 38000.0 → Higher
- 72659: 21000.0 < 38000.0 → Not higher

#### Education Level D:
- 115: 150000.0 = 150000.0 → Not higher

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a calculated yearly compensation that is more than double the average for their EdLevel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Group respondents by their EdLevel.**
2. **Calculate the average yearly compensation for each EdLevel.**
3. **Identify respondents whose yearly compensation is more than double the average for their EdLevel.**

---

### Step 1: Group respondents by EdLevel

From the data, all respondents have the same EdLevel: **""A. Primary/elementary school""**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the average yearly compensation

We will use the **CompTotal** field for yearly compensation. For respondents with **CompFreq = ""B"" (Monthly)**, we will multiply by 12 to convert to yearly compensation. For **CompFreq = ""C"" (Yearly)**, we will use the value as is.

Let's calculate the yearly compensation for each respondent:

- **Respondent 73018**: CompTotal = 53000.0, CompFreq = B → 53000.0 * 12 = 636000.0
- **Respondent 72584**: CompTotal = 28000.0, CompFreq = B → 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
- **Respondent 72683**: CompTotal = 8000.0, CompFreq = B → 8000.0 * 12 = 96000.0
- **Respondent 29141**: CompTotal = 650000.0, CompFreq = B → 650000.0 * 12 = 7800000.0
- **Respondent 248**: CompTotal = 28000.0, CompFreq = B → 28000.0 * 12 = 336000.0
- **Respondent 72793**: CompTotal = 110000.0, CompFreq = C → 110000.0
- **Respondent 73113**: CompTotal = 4600.0, CompFreq = B → 4600.0 * 12 = 55200.0
- **Respondent 72681**: CompTotal = 70000.0, CompFreq = C → 70000.0
- **Respondent 240**: CompTotal = 115000.0, CompFreq = C → 115000.0
- **Respondent 440**: CompTotal = 45000.0, CompFreq = C → 45000.0

Now, calculate the average yearly compensation:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{636000 + 336000 + 96000 + 7800000 + 336000 + 110000 + 55200 + 70000 + 115000 + 45000}{10}
$$

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{8,653,800}{10} = 865,380
$$

---

### Step 3: Identify respondents with compensation more than double the average

Double the average is:

$$
2 \times 865,380 = 1,730,760
$$

Now, identify respondents with yearly compensation > 1,730,760:

- **Respondent 29141**: 7,800,000.0 (✓)

---

### Final Answer:

**['29141']**",False
