<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8, we calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and count how many of them are less than 8.

Here are the relevant scores and their sums:

- **Respondent 71:** 5 + 3 = 8 (Not less than 8)
- **Respondent 43:** 5 + 3 = 8 (Not less than 8)
- **Respondent 17:** 5 + 5 = 10 (Not less than 8)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in groups where the average **System_Complexity** score is higher than the average **Ease_of_Use** score, we follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by their **Group** field
From the data, the groups are:
- **A. Senior**
- **B. Junior**
- **C. Middle**
- **D. Intern**

We calculate the average **System_Complexity** and **Ease_of_Use** for each group.

---

### Step 2: Calculate averages for each group

#### Group A (Senior)
- Respondent 89:
  - **System_Complexity:** 2
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 3
- Average:
  - **System_Complexity:** 2
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 3
- **System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use**

#### Group B (Junior)
- Respondent 36:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Average:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- **System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use**

#### Group C (Middle)
- Respondents 43, 22, 50, 37:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1, 2, 1, 1 → Average = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5, 4, 5, 5 → Average = (5 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.75
- **System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use**

#### Group D (Intern)
- Respondents 49, 30, 74, 71:
  - **System_Complexity:** 5, 1, 1, 1 → Average = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 2
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5, 5, 5, 5 → Average = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 5
- **System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use**

---

### Step 3: Identify groups where **System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use**
- None of the groups have **System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use**.

---

### Step 4: Count respondents in such groups
- Since no group satisfies the condition, the count is **0**.

---

### Final Answer:
0",,FALSE

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 1 + 1 + 2}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
$$

### Step 2: Identify the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores for the 'Junior' group (Group B)

From the responses:
- **Respondent 36:** 1
- **Respondent 32:** 1
- **Respondent 14:** 3

Now, count how many of these scores are greater than 1.5:
- **Respondent 36:** 1 (not greater than 1.5)
- **Respondent 32:** 1 (not greater than 1.5)
- **Respondent 14:** 3 (greater than 1.5)

Only **Respondent 14** has a score greater than 1.5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To determine how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group, we follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Identify the 'Senior' group respondents and calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score.

From the data, the 'Senior' group (Group A) includes:
- **Respondent 86:** 2
- **Respondent 13:** 1
- **Respondent 59:** 1

Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 ≈ **1.33**

---

### Step 2: Identify the 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores.

The 'Intern' group (Group D) includes:
- **Respondent 90:** 1
- **Respondent 60:** 2
- **Respondent 48:** 1
- **Respondent 77:** 1
- **Respondent 64:** 5
- **Respondent 78:** 5

---

### Step 3: Count how many 'Intern' group respondents have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score greater than 1.33.

From the 'Intern' group:
- **Respondent 64:** 5 (greater than 1.33)
- **Respondent 78:** 5 (greater than 1.33)

Only these two respondents meet the condition.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average **System_Complexity** and **Ease_of_Use** scores for each group.
2. Identify the groups where the **System_Complexity** average is greater than the **Ease_of_Use** average.
3. Count the number of respondents in those groups.

---

### Step 1: Group the data and calculate averages

#### Group A (Respondent 67)
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- **Average System_Complexity:** 1
- **Average Ease_of_Use:** 5

#### Group B (Respondent 23)
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- **Average System_Complexity:** 1
- **Average Ease_of_Use:** 4

#### Group C (Respondents 53, 70)
- **System_Complexity:** 1, 1 → Average = 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5, 5 → Average = 5

#### Group D (Respondents 90, 15, 49, 29)
- **System_Complexity:** 1, 2, 5, 1 → Average = (1 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5, 4, 5, 4 → Average = (5 + 4 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

---

### Step 2: Identify groups where **System_Complexity** > **Ease_of_Use**

- **Group A:** 1 < 5 → ❌
- **Group B:** 1 < 4 → ❌
- **Group C:** 1 < 5 → ❌
- **Group D:** 2.25 < 4.5 → ❌

None of the groups have an average **System_Complexity** greater than the average **Ease_of_Use**.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To determine how many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total positive usability score for each respondent**
We sum the values of **Ease_of_Use** and **Integration_of_Functions** for each respondent.

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 54         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 63         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 33         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 39         | C     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 44         | B     | 5           | 2                        | 7           |
| 3          | B     | 3           | 2                        | 5           |
| 10         | D     | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| 62         | C     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |

---

### **Step 2: Group respondents by their group**
We separate the data by group and calculate the average total score for each group.

- **Group A:** Respondents 35 and 11  
  Total scores: 2, 10  
  Average: (2 + 10) / 2 = **6**

- **Group B:** Respondents 44 and 3  
  Total scores: 7, 5  
  Average: (7 + 5) / 2 = **6**

- **Group C:** Respondents 54, 63, 33, 39, 62  
  Total scores: 10, 10, 10, 6, 9  
  Average: (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9) / 5 = **9**

- **Group D:** Respondent 10  
  Total score: 9  
  Average: **9**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the average for all respondents not in the same group**
For each respondent, we calculate the average total score of all other groups.

- **Respondent 35 (Group A):**  
  Other groups: B, C, D  
  Total scores: 7, 5, 10, 10, 10, 6, 9, 9  
  Average: (7 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 9) / 8 = **8.25**

- **Respondent 11 (Group A):**  
  Other groups: B, C, D  
  Total scores: 7, 5, 10, 10, 10, 6, 9, 9  
  Average: **8.25**

- **Respondent 44 (Group B):**  
  Other groups: A, C, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 10, 10, 6, 9, 9  
  Average: (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 9) / 7 = **8**

- **Respondent 3 (Group B):**  
  Other groups: A, C, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 10, 10, 6, 9, 9  
  Average: **8**

- **Respondent 54 (Group C):**  
  Other groups: A, B, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 9  
  Average: (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = **6.6**

- **Respondent 63 (Group C):**  
  Other groups: A, B, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 9  
  Average: **6.6**

- **Respondent 33 (Group C):**  
  Other groups: A, B, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 9  
  Average: **6.6**

- **Respondent 39 (Group C):**  
  Other groups: A, B, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 9  
  Average: **6.6**

- **Respondent 62 (Group C):**  
  Other groups: A, B, D  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 9  
  Average: **6.6**

- **Respondent 10 (Group D):**  
  Other groups: A, B, C  
  Total scores: 2, 10, 7, 5, 10, 10, 6  
  Average: (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 6) / 7 = **7.14**

---

### **Step 4: Count how many respondents have a total score lower than the average of other groups**
We compare each respondent's total score to the average of other groups.

| Respondent | Total Score | Other Group Average | Is Score < Average? |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 35         | 2           | 8.25                | Yes                 |
| 11         | 10          | 8.25                | No                  |
| 44         | 7           | 8                   | Yes                 |
| 3          | 5           | 8                   | Yes                 |
| 54         | 10          | 6.6                 | No                  |
| 63         | 10          | 6.6                 | No                  |
| 33         | 10          | 6.6                 | No                  |
| 39         | 6           | 6.6                 | Yes                 |
| 62         | 9           | 6.6                 | No                  |
| 10         | 9           | 7.14                | No                  |

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this, we will:

1. **Group the respondents by their 'Group'**.
2. **Calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group**.
3. **Identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use'**.
4. **Count the number of respondents in those groups**.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents

From the data, the groups are:
- **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 82, 20
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 10, 30

---

### Step 2: Calculate averages for each group

#### Group A (Senior)
- **System_Complexity:** (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 4 → Average = 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) = 18 → Average = 4.5

#### Group C (Middle)
- **System_Complexity:** (1 + 1) = 2 → Average = 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** (4 + 5) = 9 → Average = 4.5

#### Group D (Intern)
- **System_Complexity:** (1 + 1) = 2 → Average = 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** (4 + 5) = 9 → Average = 4.5

---

### Step 3: Identify groups where 'System_Complexity' > 'Ease_of_Use'

- **Group A:** 1 < 4.5 → ❌
- **Group C:** 1 < 4.5 → ❌
- **Group D:** 1 < 4.5 → ❌

No group has an average 'System_Complexity' higher than 'Ease_of_Use'.

---

### Step 4: Count respondents in such groups

Since no group meets the condition, the count is:

**0**",,FALSE
case_47,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To determine the respondents in groups where the average **System_Complexity** score is higher than the average **Ease_of_Use** score, we follow these steps:

1. **Group the respondents by their 'Group' field.**
2. **For each group, calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores.**
3. **Identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Use'.**
4. **Count the number of respondents in those groups.**

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents

From the data, the groups are:
- **A (Senior):** Respondents 46, 56, 59
- **B (Junior):** Respondents 44, 66, 79
- **C (Middle):** Respondents 9, 33, 50, 51
- **D (Intern):** Respondents 71, 74

---

### Step 2: Calculate averages for each group

#### Group A (Senior)
- **System_Complexity:** (1 + 2 + 1) = 4 → Average = 4 / 3 = **1.33**
- **Ease_of_Use:** (1 + 4 + 5) = 10 → Average = 10 / 3 = **3.33**
- **Comparison:** 1.33 < 3.33 → **Not selected**

#### Group B (Junior)
- **System_Complexity:** (2 + 1 + 1) = 4 → Average = 4 / 3 = **1.33**
- **Ease_of_Use:** (5 + 5 + 5) = 15 → Average = 15 / 3 = **5.00**
- **Comparison:** 1.33 < 5.00 → **Not selected**

#### Group C (Middle)
- **System_Complexity:** (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 6 → Average = 6 / 4 = **1.50**
- **Ease_of_Use:** (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) = 16 → Average = 16 / 4 = **4.00**
- **Comparison:** 1.50 < 4.00 → **Not selected**

#### Group D (Intern)
- **System_Complexity:** (1 + 1) = 2 → Average = 2 / 2 = **1.00**
- **Ease_of_Use:** (5 + 5) = 10 → Average = 10 / 2 = **5.00**
- **Comparison:** 1.00 < 5.00 → **Not selected**

---

### Step 3: Identify groups where **System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use**

None of the groups meet the condition **System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use**.

---

### Step 4: Count respondents in those groups

Since no group satisfies the condition, the count is **0**.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To determine the respondents who are in a group where the average **System_Complexity** score is higher than the average **Ease_of_Use** score, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average System_Complexity and Ease_of_Use scores for each group.**
2. **Identify the groups where the average System_Complexity is greater than the average Ease_of_Use.**
3. **Count the number of respondents in those groups.**

---

### Step 1: Group the data and calculate averages

#### Group A (Senior)
- Respondents: 42, 6
- System_Complexity: 1, 1 → Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Ease_of_Use: 5, 4 → Average = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
- **System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)** → Not included

#### Group B (Junior)
- Respondents: 66, 36
- System_Complexity: 1, 1 → Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Ease_of_Use: 5, 5 → Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
- **System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)** → Not included

#### Group C (Middle)
- Respondents: 9, 53, 88
- System_Complexity: 3, 1, 2 → Average = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
- Ease_of_Use: 1, 5, 5 → Average = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67
- **System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (3.67)** → Not included

#### Group D (Intern)
- Respondents: 45, 15, 71, 7
- System_Complexity: 1, 2, 1, 1 → Average = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
- Ease_of_Use: 4, 4, 5, 5 → Average = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
- **System_Complexity (1.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)** → Not included

---

### Step 2: Identify groups where System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use
- None of the groups meet the condition **System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use**.

---

### Step 3: Count respondents in those groups
- No groups qualify, so the count is **0**.

---

### Final Answer:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To determine how many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total positive usability score for each respondent**
We sum the values of **Ease_of_Use** and **Integration_of_Functions** for each respondent.

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Usability Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4                      |
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2                      |
| 47         | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9                      |
| 82         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8                      |
| 32         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10                     |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8                      |
| 61         | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3                      |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10                     |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10                     |

---

### **Step 2: Group respondents by their group and calculate the average usability score for each group**

| Group | Respondents | Total Usability Scores | Average Usability Score |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| A     | 35, 89, 11  | 2, 8, 10               | (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 6.67  |
| B     | 47, 32, 61  | 9, 10, 3               | (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 7.33  |
| C     | 82, 43      | 8, 10                  | (8 + 10) / 2 = 9         |
| D     | 64          | 4                      | 4                        |

---

### **Step 3: For each respondent, calculate the average usability score of all respondents **not in their group**, and compare it to their own score**

We calculate the average usability score of all other groups for each respondent.

#### **Respondent 64 (Group D)**
- Other groups: A, B, C
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10 = 60

- Respondent 35's score: 2
- **2 < 7.33 → Counted**

#### **Respondent 47 (Group B)**
- Other groups: A, C, D
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 42
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 42 / 6 = **7**
- Respondent 47's score: 9
- **9 > 7 → Not counted**

#### **Respondent 82 (Group C)**
- Other groups: A, B, D
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 36
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 36 / 6 = **6**
- Respondent 82's score: 8
- **8 > 6 → Not counted**

#### **Respondent 32 (Group B)**
- Other groups: A, C, D
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 42
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 42 / 6 = **7**
- Respondent 32's score: 10
- **10 > 7 → Not counted**

#### **Respondent 89 (Group A)**
- Other groups: B, C, D
- Total scores: 9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 44
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 44 / 6 = **7.33**
- Respondent 89's score: 8
- **8 > 7.33 → Not counted**

#### **Respondent 61 (Group B)**
- Other groups: A, C, D
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 42
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 42 / 6 = **7**
- Respondent 61's score: 3
- **3 < 7 → Counted**

#### **Respondent 43 (Group C)**
- Other groups: A, B, D
- Total scores: 2 + 8 + 10 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 36
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 36 / 6 = **6**
- Respondent 43's score: 10
- **10 > 6 → Not counted**

#### **Respondent 11 (Group A)**
- Other groups: B, C, D
- Total scores: 9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 44
- Total respondents in other groups: 6
- Average: 44 / 6 = **7.33**
- Respondent 11's score: 10
- **10 > 7.33 → Not counted**

---

### **Step 4: Count how many respondents meet the condition**
Respondents who have a total usability score **lower than the average of all respondents not in their group**:
- 64
- 35
- 61

**Total: 3**
