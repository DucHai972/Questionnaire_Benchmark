<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group.
2. Identify respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group.
3. List the IDs of these respondents.

### Step 1: Group the respondents and calculate average 'Inconsistency' scores

#### Group A (Senior)
- Respondent 89: Inconsistency = 3
- Average = 3

#### Group B (Junior)
- Respondent 36: Inconsistency = 1
- Average = 1

#### Group C (Middle)
- Respondent 43: Inconsistency = 1  
- Respondent 22: Inconsistency = 5  
- Respondent 50: Inconsistency = 2  
- Respondent 37: Inconsistency = 1  
- Average = (1 + 5 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25

#### Group D (Intern)
- Respondent 49: Inconsistency = 4  
- Respondent 30: Inconsistency = 1  
- Respondent 74: Inconsistency = 3  
- Respondent 71: Inconsistency = 2  
- Average = (4 + 1 + 3 + 2) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

### Step 2: Identify respondents with 'Inconsistency' score higher than the group average

#### Group A (Senior)
- Respondent 89: Inconsistency = 3 (equal to average, not higher)

#### Group B (Junior)
- Respondent 36: Inconsistency = 1 (equal to average, not higher)

#### Group C (Middle)
- Respondent 22: Inconsistency = 5 (> 2.25) → Include

#### Group D (Intern)
- Respondent 49: Inconsistency = 4 (> 2.5) → Include

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') higher than the average for their group, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent**
The negative usability score is the sum of:
- **System_Complexity**
- **Inconsistency**
- **Cumbersome_to_Use**

We calculate this for each respondent.

---

### **Step 2: Group respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average negative usability score for each group**

---

### **Step 3: Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group**

---

### **Calculations**

#### **Group A (Senior)**
Respondents:
- **Respondent 86**: System_Complexity = 5, Inconsistency = 3, Cumbersome_to_Use = 5 → Total = 13
- **Respondent 13**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3
- **Respondent 59**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3

Average = (13 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 19 / 3 ≈ 6.33

Respondents with total > 6.33:
- **Respondent 86**

---

#### **Group C (Middle)**
Respondents:
- **Respondent 5**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3
- **Respondent 37**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3
- **Respondent 19**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2 → Total = 4

Average = (3 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 10 / 3 ≈ 3.33

Respondents with total > 3.33:
- **Respondent 19**

---

#### **Group D (Intern)**
Respondents:
- **Respondent 90**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 2, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2 → Total = 5
- **Respondent 60**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 2, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 4
- **Respondent 48**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3
- **Respondent 77**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1 → Total = 3
- **Respondent 64**: System_Complexity = 3, Inconsistency = 4, Cumbersome_to_Use = 4 → Total = 11
- **Respondent 78**: System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 4, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2 → Total = 7

Average = (5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 7) / 6 = 33 / 6 = 5.5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents in the 'Middle' group and calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for this group.
2. Identify all respondents in the 'Junior' group.
3. Filter the 'Junior' group respondents to those whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the calculated average.
4. List the IDs of these respondents.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group

From the 'responses' section, the 'Middle' group corresponds to **Group: C**.

- **Respondent 53** (Group: C, Ease_of_Learning: 5)
- **Respondent 70** (Group: C, Ease_of_Learning: 5)

Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = **5**

---

### Step 2: Identify 'Junior' group respondents

From the 'responses' section, the 'Junior' group corresponds to **Group: B**.

- **Respondent 23** (Group: B, Ease_of_Learning: 4)

---

### Step 3: Filter 'Junior' group respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than 5

- Respondent 23 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' of 4, which is **not** higher than 5.

---

### Step 4: List the IDs of qualifying respondents

There are **no** respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents in the 'Junior' group and calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for this group.
2. Identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group.
3. Compare the 'Confidence_in_Use' of each 'Intern' group respondent to the average 'Confidence_in_Use' of the 'Junior' group.
4. List the respondents from the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group

From the responses, the 'Junior' group corresponds to **Group: B**.

Respondents in the 'Junior' group:
- **Respondent 44**: Confidence_in_Use = 1
- **Respondent 3**: Confidence_in_Use = 5

Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = **3**

---

### Step 2: Identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group

The 'Intern' group corresponds to **Group: D**.

Respondents in the 'Intern' group:
- **Respondent 10**: Confidence_in_Use = 5

---

### Step 3: Compare 'Confidence_in_Use' of 'Intern' group to the 'Junior' group average

Respondent 10 has a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 5, which is **greater than 3** (the average for the 'Junior' group).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') higher than the average for their group, I will:

1. Calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent.
2. Group respondents by their 'Group'.
3. Compute the average total negative usability score for each group.
4. Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate total negative usability score for each respondent

| Respondent | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Negative Usability Score |
|------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 10         | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 52         | A     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 6          | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 76         | A     | 1                 | 2             | 2                 | 5                             |
| 30         | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 82         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 2                 | 4                             |
| 67         | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 20         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |

---

### Step 2: Compute average total negative usability score per group

- **Group A:** (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = **3.75**
- **Group C:** (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = **3.5**
- **Group D:** (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = **3**

---

### Step 3: Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group

- **Group A:** Respondents with score > 3.75 → **Respondent 76 (5)**
- **Group C:** Respondents with score > 3.5 → **Respondent 82 (4)**
- **Group D:** Respondents with score > 3 → None

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') higher than the average for their group, I will:

1. Calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent.
2. Group respondents by their 'Group'.
3. Compute the average total negative usability score for each group.
4. Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

| 46         | A     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 9          | C     | 3                 | 5             | 3                 | 11                            |
| 56         | A     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 71         | D     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 59         | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 74         | D     | 1                 | 3             | 1                 | 5                             |
| 44         | B     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4                             |

| 66         | B     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 50         | C     | 1                 | 2             | 2                 | 5                             |
| 51         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 79         | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |

---

### Step 2: Group by 'Group' and calculate average total negative usability score

| Group | Total Negative Usability Scores | Count | Average |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------|---------|
| A     | 4, 4, 3                          | 3     | 3.67    |
| B     | 4, 4, 3                          | 3     | 3.67    |
| C     | 11, 3, 5, 3                      | 4     | 5.25    |
| D     | 4, 5                             | 2     | 4.5     |

---

### Step 3: Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group

- **Group A (Average = 3.67):** No respondents have a score higher than 3.67.
- **Group B (Average = 3.67):** No respondents have a score higher than 3.67.
- **Group C (Average = 5.25):** No respondents have a score higher than 5.25.
- **Group D (Average = 4.5):** No respondents have a score higher than 4.5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') higher than the average for their group, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent**:
   - Score = System_Complexity + Inconsistency + Cumbersome_to_Use

2. **Group the respondents by their 'Group'**.

3. **Calculate the average total negative usability score for each group**.

4. **Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group**.

### Step 1: Calculate total negative usability scores

| Respondent | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 9          | C     | 3                 | 5             | 3                 | 11          |
| 45         | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 53         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 15         | D     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4           |

| 71         | D     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4           |
| 66         | B     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4           |
| 7          | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 88         | C     | 2                 | 3             | 2                 | 7           |
| 6          | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 36         | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |

---

### Step 2: Group by 'Group' and calculate average total score

- **Group A (Respondents 42, 6)**:
  - Total scores: 3, 3
  - Average: (3 + 3) / 2 = 3

- **Group B (Respondents 66, 36)**:
  - Total scores: 4, 3
  - Average: (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5

- **Group C (Respondents 9, 53, 88)**:
  - Total scores: 11, 3, 7
  - Average: (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7

- **Group D (Respondents 45, 15, 71, 7)**:
  - Total scores: 3, 4, 4, 3
  - Average: (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5

---

### Step 3: Identify respondents with total score > group average

- **Group A**:
  - No one exceeds the average (3).

- **Group B**:
  - Respondent 66 (4) > 3.5 → Include

- **Group C**:
  - Respondent 9 (11) > 7 → Include
  - Respondent 88 (7) = 7 → Not included

- **Group D**:
  - No one exceeds the average (3.5).

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') higher than the average for their group, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent**
The formula is:  
**Total Negative Usability Score = System_Complexity + Inconsistency + Cumbersome_to_Use**

We calculate this for each respondent:

| Respondent | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Negative Usability Score |
|------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 64         | D     | 3                 | 4             | 4                 | 11                            |
| 35         | A     | 5                 | 5             | 5                 | 15                            |
| 47         | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 82         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 2                 | 4                             |
| 32         | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 89         | A     | 2                 | 3             | 1                 | 6                             |
| 61         | B     | 5                 | 4             | 5                 | 14                            |
| 43         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 11         | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |

---

### **Step 2: Group respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group**

#### Group A (Respondents: 35, 89, 11)
- Total Negative Usability Scores: 15, 6, 3
- Average: (15 + 6 + 3) / 3 = **8**

#### Group B (Respondents: 47, 32, 61)
- Total Negative Usability Scores: 3, 3, 14
- Average: (3 + 3 + 14) / 3 = **10**

#### Group C (Respondents: 82, 43)
- Total Negative Usability Scores: 4, 3
- Average: (4 + 3) / 2 = **3.5**

#### Group D (Respondent: 64)
- Total Negative Usability Score: 11
- Average: 11 (only one respondent)

---

### **Step 3: Identify respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group**

#### Group A:
- 35: 15 > 8 → ✅
- 89: 6 < 8 → ❌
- 11: 3 < 8 → ❌

#### Group B:
- 47: 3 < 10 → ❌
- 32: 3 < 10 → ❌
- 61: 14 > 10 → ✅

#### Group C:
- 82: 4 > 3.5 → ✅
- 43: 3 < 3.5 → ❌

#### Group D:
- 64: 11 = 11 → ❌ (not higher than the average)

---

### **Final Answer:**
**35, 61, 82**",False
