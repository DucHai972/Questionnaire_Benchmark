<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 8.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 8, we calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and count how many of them are less than 8.

Here are the calculations:

1. **Respondent 10:** 5 (Frequent_Usage) + 1 (System_Complexity) = 6 → less than 8
2. **Respondent 28:** 5 + 1 = 6 → less than 8
3. **Respondent 19:** 1 + 1 = 2 → less than 8
4. **Respondent 39:** 2 + 4 = 6 → less than 8
5. **Respondent 90:** 5 + 1 = 6 → less than 8
6. **Respondent 31:** 2 + 1 = 3 → less than 8
7. **Respondent 64:** 1 + 3 = 4 → less than 8
8. **Respondent 4:** 4 + 1 = 5 → less than 8
9. **Respondent 5:** 5 + 1 = 6 → less than 8

All 9 respondents have a combined score less than 8.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 4.
</task>","To solve this, we calculate the combined score for ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" and ""System_Complexity"" for each respondent and count how many of them have a total score less than 4.

### Step-by-step:
1. **Respondent 74:** 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) + 1 (System_Complexity) = 2 → less than 4 → counted
2. **Respondent 22:** 2 + 2 = 4 → not less than 4 → not counted
3. **Respondent 81:** 2 + 1 = 3 → less than 4 → counted
4. **Respondent 30:** 1 + 1 = 2 → less than 4 → counted
5. **Respondent 36:** 1 + 1 = 2 → less than 4 → counted
6. **Respondent 62:** 1 + 1 = 2 → less than 4 → counted
7. **Respondent 84:** 4 + 3 = 7 → not less than 4 → not counted
8. **Respondent 69:** 1 + 4 = 5 → not less than 4 → not counted

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of **Ease_of_Use** and **Integration_of_Functions**.
2. Group the respondents by their **Group**.
3. For each group, calculate the average total positive usability score of all respondents **not in that group**.
4. Count how many respondents in each group have a total positive usability score **lower than** the average of the other groups.

---

### Step 1: Compute total positive usability score for each respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 49         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 30         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 22         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| 50         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 74         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| 37         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 71         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 36         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Group by **Group** and calculate average total score for other groups

#### Group A (Respondent 89)
- Total score: 8
- Other groups: B, C, D
- Total scores of other groups: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9
- Average of other groups: (10 * 8 + 9) / 9 = 9.89
- 8 < 9.89 → **Count = 1**

#### Group B (Respondent 36)
- Total score: 10
- Other groups: A, C, D
- Total scores of other groups: 8, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9
- Average of other groups: (8 + 10 * 7 + 9) / 9 = 9.67
- 10 > 9.67 → **Count = 0**

#### Group C (Respondents 43, 22, 50, 37)
- Total scores: 10, 8, 10, 10
- Other groups: A, B, D
- Total scores of other groups: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9
- Average of other groups: (8 + 10 * 5 + 9) / 7 = 9.57
- Count how many in Group C have total score < 9.57:
  - 8 < 9.57 → **Count = 1**

#### Group D (Respondents 49, 30, 74, 71)
- Total scores: 10, 10, 10, 9
- Other groups: A, B, C
- Total scores of other groups: 8, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10
- Average of other groups: (8 * 2 + 10 * 5) / 7 = 9.43
- Count how many in Group D have total score < 9.43:
  - 9 < 9.43 → **Count = 1**

---

### Final Count

- Group A: 1
- Group B: 0
- Group C: 1
- Group D: 1

**Total = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average **System_Complexity** score for each **Group**.
2. Count the number of respondents in each **Group** whose **System_Complexity** score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by **Group** and calculate the average **System_Complexity** for each group.

#### Group A: No respondents in the data.
- Average = Not applicable.

#### Group B:
- Respondents: 36, 32, 14
- System_Complexity: 1, 1, 1
- Average = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = **1**

#### Group C:
- Respondents: 82, 4, 87, 70
- System_Complexity: 1, 1, 2, 1
- Average = (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = **1.25**

#### Group D:
- Respondents: 15, 29, 18, 12
- System_Complexity: 2, 1, 1, 2
- Average = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = **1.5**

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents in each group whose **System_Complexity** is higher than the group's average.

#### Group B:
- All scores = 1
- None are higher than the average (1).
- Count = **0**

#### Group C:
- Scores: 1, 1, 2, 1
- Only one score (2) is higher than the average (1.25).
- Count = **1**

#### Group D:
- Scores: 2, 1, 1, 2
- Two scores (2, 2) are higher than the average (1.5).
- Count = **2**

---

### Final Count:
- Total = 0 (Group B) + 1 (Group C) + 2 (Group D) = **3**

---

**Answer: 3**",,FALSE
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"# Survey Data

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of **Ease_of_Use** and **Integration_of_Functions**.
2. Group the respondents by their **Group**.
3. For each group, calculate the average total positive usability score of all respondents **not in that group**.
4. Count how many respondents in each group have a total positive usability score **lower than the average** of the other groups.

### Step 2: Group by **Group** and calculate average total score for **other groups**

#### Group A (Respondents 86, 13, 59)
- Total scores: 6, 10, 10
- Average: (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 8.67

#### Group B (No respondents in this group)

#### Group C (Respondents 5, 37, 19)
- Total scores: 10, 10, 8
- Average: (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 9.33

#### Group D (Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78)
- Total scores: 10, 9, 10, 9, 4, 7
- Average: (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 8.17

---

### Step 3: Compare each respondent's score to the average of the **other groups**

#### Group A
- Respondent 86: 6 < 9.33 (Group C average) and 6 < 8.17 (Group D average) → **Lower than both**
- Respondent 13: 10 > 9.33 and 10 > 8.17 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 59: 10 > 9.33 and 10 > 8.17 → **Not lower**
- **Count for Group A: 1**

#### Group C
- Respondent 5: 10 > 8.67 (Group A average) and 10 > 8.17 (Group D average) → **Not lower**
- Respondent 37: 10 > 8.67 and 10 > 8.17 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 19: 8 < 8.67 and 8 < 8.17 → **Lower than both**
- **Count for Group C: 1**

#### Group D
- Respondent 90: 10 > 8.67 and 10 > 9.33 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 60: 9 > 8.67 and 9 > 9.33 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 48: 10 > 8.67 and 10 > 9.33 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 77: 9 > 8.67 and 9 > 9.33 → **Not lower**
- Respondent 64: 4 < 8.67 and 4 < 9.33 → **Lower than both**
- Respondent 78: 7 < 8.67 and 7 < 9.33 → **Lower than both**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their **Group**.
2. For each group, calculate the **average Integration_of_Functions** score.
3. Count the number of respondents in each group whose **Integration_of_Functions** score is **greater than** the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by **Group**

From the **Responses** section:

- **Group A (Senior):**
  - Respondent 67: Integration_of_Functions = 5

- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Respondent 23: Integration_of_Functions = 4

- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Respondent 53: Integration_of_Functions = 5
  - Respondent 70: Integration_of_Functions = 5

- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Respondent 90: Integration_of_Functions = 5
  - Respondent 15: Integration_of_Functions = 5
  - Respondent 49: Integration_of_Functions = 5
  - Respondent 29: Integration_of_Functions = 4

---

### Step 2: Calculate the average **Integration_of_Functions** for each group

- **Group A (Senior):**
  - Average = 5 (only one respondent)

- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Average = 4 (only one respondent)

- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Average = (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 4.75

---

### Step 3: Count respondents whose **Integration_of_Functions** is greater than the group average

- **Group A (Senior):**
  - Respondent 67: 5 > 5 → **No**

- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Respondent 23: 4 > 4 → **No**

- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Respondent 53: 5 > 5 → **No**
  - Respondent 70: 5 > 5 → **No**

- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Respondent 90: 5 > 4.75 → **Yes**
  - Respondent 15: 5 > 4.75 → **Yes**
  - Respondent 49: 5 > 4.75 → **Yes**
  - Respondent 29: 4 > 4.75 → **No**

---

### Final Count

- Respondents with **Integration_of_Functions** > group average: **3**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average **Confidence_in_Use** score for each **Group**.
2. Count the number of respondents in each group whose **Confidence_in_Use** score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by **Group** and calculate the average **Confidence_in_Use** for each group.

#### Group A:
- Respondent 35: 1
- Respondent 11: 3  
**Average = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 44: 1
- Respondent 3: 5  
**Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 54: 4
- Respondent 63: 5
- Respondent 33: 4
- Respondent 39: 4
- Respondent 62: 5  
**Average = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 10: 5  
**Average = 5**

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents whose **Confidence_in_Use** is higher than the group average.

#### Group A:
- Respondent 35: 1 (≤ 2) → No
- Respondent 11: 3 (> 2) → Yes  
**Count = 1**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 44: 1 (≤ 3) → No
- Respondent 3: 5 (> 3) → Yes  
**Count = 1**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 54: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 63: 5 (> 4.4) → Yes
- Respondent 33: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 39: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 62: 5 (> 4.4) → Yes  
**Count = 2**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 10: 5 (= 5) → No  
**Count = 0**

---

### Final Count:
**1 (Group A) + 1 (Group B) + 2 (Group C) + 0 (Group D) = 4**

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their **Group**.
2. For each group, calculate the **average Integration_of_Functions** score.
3. Count how many respondents in each group have an **Integration_of_Functions** score higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by **Group**

#### Group A (Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67)
- Respondent 52: 4
- Respondent 6: 5
- Respondent 76: 4
- Respondent 67: 5
- **Average**: (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
- **Respondents with score > 4.5**: Respondent 6 (5), Respondent 67 (5) → **2**

#### Group C (Respondents 82, 20)
- Respondent 82: 4
- Respondent 20: 4
- **Average**: (4 + 4) / 2 = 4
- **Respondents with score > 4**: None → **0**

#### Group D (Respondents 10, 30)
- Respondent 10: 5
- Respondent 30: 5
- **Average**: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
- **Respondents with score > 5**: None → **0**

---

### Step 2: Total count

- Group A: 2
- Group C: 0
- Group D: 0

**Total = 2**

---

### Final Answer:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group.**
2. **Count the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is higher than this average.**

---

### Step 1: Identify 'Middle' group respondents and calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score

From the data, the 'Middle' group corresponds to **Group: C**.

**Middle group respondents:**
- **Respondent 9** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 3)
- **Respondent 33** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 1)
- **Respondent 50** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 2)
- **Respondent 51** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 1)

**Cumbersome_to_Use scores for Middle group:**
- 3, 1, 2, 1

**Average = (3 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75**

---

### Step 2: Identify 'Junior' group respondents and compare their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores to the average

The 'Junior' group corresponds to **Group: B**.

**Junior group respondents:**
- **Respondent 44** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 1)
- **Respondent 66** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 1)
- **Respondent 79** (Cumbersome_to_Use: 1)

**Cumbersome_to_Use scores for Junior group:**
- 1, 1, 1

**Compare to the average of 1.75:**
- None of the scores (1) are greater than 1.75.

- Average: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- Respondents with Ease_of_Use > 5: None → 0 respondents

#### Group B (Respondent 69)
- Ease_of_Use: 5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average **Need_for_Technical_Support** score for each **Group**.
2. Count the number of respondents in each group whose **Need_for_Technical_Support** score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by their **Group** and calculate the average **Need_for_Technical_Support** for each group.

#### Group A:
- Respondents: 42, 6
- Scores: 5, 1
- Average: (5 + 1) / 2 = **3**

#### Group B:
- Respondents: 66, 36
- Scores: 1, 1
- Average: (1 + 1) / 2 = **1**

#### Group C:
- Respondents: 9, 53, 88
- Scores: 5, 1, 2
- Average: (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = **2.67**

#### Group D:
- Respondents: 45, 15, 71, 7
- Scores: 1, 1, 1, 1
- Average: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = **1**

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents whose **Need_for_Technical_Support** score is higher than the group's average.

#### Group A:
- Respondent 42: 5 > 3 → **Yes**
- Respondent 6: 1 < 3 → **No**
- Count: **1**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 66: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Respondent 36: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Count: **0**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 9: 5 > 2.67 → **Yes**
- Respondent 53: 1 < 2.67 → **No**
- Respondent 88: 2 < 2.67 → **No**
- Count: **1**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 45: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Respondent 15: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Respondent 71: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Respondent 7: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Count: **0**

---

### Final Count:
- Total = 1 (Group A) + 0 (Group B) + 1 (Group C) + 0 (Group D) = **2**

**Answer: 2**",,FALSE
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of **Ease_of_Use** and **Integration_of_Functions**.
2. Compute the average total positive usability score for each group (A, B, C, D).
3. For each respondent, compare their total positive usability score to the average of all respondents **not in their group**.
4. Count the number of respondents whose score is **lower than the average** of the other groups.

---

### Step 1: Compute total positive usability scores

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4     |
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2     |
| 47         | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9     |
| 82         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8     |
| 32         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10    |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8     |
| 61         | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3     |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10    |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10    |

---

### Step 2: Compute average total positive usability score for each group

- **Group A:** (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 6.67
- **Group B:** (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 7.33
- **Group C:** (8 + 10) / 2 = 9
- **Group D:** (4) / 1 = 4

---

### Step 3: Compute the average for all respondents **not in the same group** for each respondent

- **Respondent 64 (Group D):** Average of A, B, C = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9) / 3 = 7.67
- **Respondent 35 (Group A):** Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.78
- **Respondent 47 (Group B):** Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.56
- **Respondent 82 (Group C):** Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 6.00
- **Respondent 32 (Group B):** Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.56
- **Respondent 89 (Group A):** Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.78
- **Respondent 61 (Group B):** Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.56
- **Respondent 43 (Group C):** Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 6.00
- **Respondent 11 (Group A):** Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 6.78

---

### Step 4: Count respondents whose score is **lower than the average of other groups**

| Respondent | Total | Other Group Average | Is Lower? |
|------------|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| 64         | 4     | 7.67                | Yes       |
| 35         | 2     | 6.78                | Yes       |
| 47         | 9     | 6.56                | No        |
| 82         | 8     | 6.00                | No        |
| 32         | 10    | 6.56                | No        |
| 89         | 8     | 6.78                | No        |
| 61         | 3     | 6.56                | Yes       |
| 43         | 10    | 6.00                | No        |
| 11         | 10    | 6.78                | No        |

---

### Final Count

There are **3** respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average of all respondents not in their group.

**Answer: 3**",,FALSE
