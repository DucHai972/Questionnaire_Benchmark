<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of their 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' scores.
2. Group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total positive usability score for all respondents not in their group.
3. Count how many respondents have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.

### Step 1: Calculate total positive usability scores

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 49         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 30         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 22         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| 50         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 74         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| 37         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 71         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 36         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Group by 'Group' and calculate average total score for all respondents not in the group

#### Group A (Respondent 89)
- Total score: 8
- Other groups: B, C, D
- Total scores for B, C, D: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10
- Average for other groups: (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 10) / 9 = 9.89
- 8 < 9.89 → Counted

#### Group B (Respondent 36)
- Total score: 10
- Other groups: A, C, D
- Total scores for A, C, D: 8, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10
- Average for other groups: (8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 10) / 9 = 9.44
- 10 > 9.44 → Not counted

#### Group C (Respondents 43, 22, 50, 37)
- Total scores: 10, 8, 10, 10
- Other groups: A, B, D
- Total scores for A, B, D: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10
- Average for other groups: (8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 10) / 7 = 9.57
- 10 > 9.57 → Not counted
- 8 < 9.57 → Counted

#### Group D (Respondents 49, 30, 74, 71)
- Total scores: 10, 10, 10, 9
- Other groups: A, B, C
- Total scores for A, B, C: 8, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10
- Average for other groups: (8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 7 = 9.43
- 10 > 9.43 → Not counted
- 9 < 9.43 → Counted

---

### Step 3: Count total respondents who meet the condition

- Respondent 89 (Group A): Counted
- Respondent 22 (Group C): Counted
- Respondent 71 (Group D): Counted

**Total: 3**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `Group`.
2. Calculate the average `System_Complexity` score for each group.
3. Count the number of respondents in each group whose `System_Complexity` score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by `Group` and calculate the average `System_Complexity` for each group

#### Group A: No respondents
- No data to calculate.

#### Group B: Respondents 36, 32, 14
- System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1
- Average: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = **1**

#### Group C: Respondents 82, 4, 87, 70
- System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 2, 1
- Average: (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = **1.25**

#### Group D: Respondents 15, 29, 18, 12
- System_Complexity scores: 2, 1, 1, 2
- Average: (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = **1.5**

---

### Step 2: Count respondents whose `System_Complexity` is higher than the group average

#### Group B:
- All scores (1) are equal to the average (1). No one is above the average.

#### Group C:
- Scores: 1, 1, 2, 1
- Only one score (2) is above the average (1.25). Count = **1**

#### Group D:
- Scores: 2, 1, 1, 2
- Two scores (2, 2) are above the average (1.5). Count = **2**

---

### Final Count:
- Group C: 1
- Group D: 2
- Total = **3**

---

</task>","To solve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of their `Ease_of_Use` and `Integration_of_Functions` scores.
2. Group the respondents by their `Group` and calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.
3. For each respondent, compare their total positive usability score to the average of all respondents **not in their group**.
4. Count how many respondents have a total positive usability score **lower than** the average of all respondents not in their group.

### Step 1: Compute total positive usability scores
| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 5          | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 37         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 90         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 19         | C     | 5           | 3                        | 8           |
| 60         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 48         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 86         | A     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 13         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 59         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 77         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 78         | D     | 3           | 4                        | 7           |

---

### Step 2: Group by `Group` and calculate average total score
- **Group A**: (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 ≈ 8.67
- **Group C**: (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 ≈ 9.33
- **Group D**: (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 ≈ 8.17

---

### Step 3: Compute the average for all respondents **not in the same group** for each respondent

#### Group A respondents:
- **Respondent 86 (Group A)**: Compare 6 to the average of all **not in A** (C and D).
  - Total scores for C and D: 10 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7 = 77
  - Count: 9
  - Average: 77 / 9 ≈ 8.56
  - 6 < 8.56 → ✅

- **Respondent 13 (Group A)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in A** (C and D) → 8.56
  - 10 > 8.56 → ❌

- **Respondent 59 (Group A)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in A** (C and D) → 8.56
  - 10 > 8.56 → ❌

#### Group C respondents:
- **Respondent 5 (Group C)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in C** (A and D).
  - Total scores for A and D: 6 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7 = 75
  - Count: 9
  - Average: 75 / 9 ≈ 8.33
  - 10 > 8.33 → ❌

- **Respondent 37 (Group C)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in C** (A and D) → 8.33
  - 10 > 8.33 → ❌

- **Respondent 19 (Group C)**: Compare 8 to the average of all **not in C** (A and D) → 8.33
  - 8 < 8.33 → ✅

#### Group D respondents:
- **Respondent 90 (Group D)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C).
  - Total scores for A and C: 6 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 8 = 44
  - Count: 5
  - Average: 44 / 5 = 8.8
  - 10 > 8.8 → ❌

- **Respondent 60 (Group D)**: Compare 9 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C) → 8.8
  - 9 > 8.8 → ❌

- **Respondent 48 (Group D)**: Compare 10 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C) → 8.8
  - 10 > 8.8 → ❌

- **Respondent 77 (Group D)**: Compare 9 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C) → 8.8
  - 9 > 8.8 → ❌

- **Respondent 64 (Group D)**: Compare 4 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C) → 8.8
  - 4 < 8.8 → ✅

- **Respondent 78 (Group D)**: Compare 7 to the average of all **not in D** (A and C) → 8.8
  - 7 < 8.8 → ✅

### Step 4: Count the number of respondents who meet the condition
- Respondent 86 (Group A): ✅
- Respondent 19 (Group C): ✅
- Respondent 64 (Group D): ✅
- Respondent 78 (Group D): ✅

✅ Total: **4**

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `Group`.
2. Calculate the average `Integration_of_Functions` score for each group.
3. Count the number of respondents in each group whose `Integration_of_Functions` score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by `Group` and calculate the average `Integration_of_Functions` for each group

#### Group A:
- Respondent 67: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Average = 5

#### Group B:
- Respondent 23: `Integration_of_Functions` = 4
- Average = 4

#### Group C:
- Respondent 53: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Respondent 70: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

#### Group D:
- Respondent 90: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Respondent 15: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Respondent 49: `Integration_of_Functions` = 5
- Respondent 29: `Integration_of_Functions` = 4
- Average = (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 4.75

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents whose `Integration_of_Functions` score is higher than the group average

#### Group A:
- Respondent 67: 5 > 5 → No

#### Group B:
- Respondent 23: 4 > 4 → No

#### Group C:
- Respondent 53: 5 > 5 → No
- Respondent 70: 5 > 5 → No

#### Group D:
- Respondent 90: 5 > 4.75 → Yes
- Respondent 15: 5 > 4.75 → Yes
- Respondent 49: 5 > 4.75 → Yes
- Respondent 29: 4 > 4.75 → No

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `Group` value.
2. For each group, calculate the average `Confidence_in_Use` score.
3. Count how many respondents in each group have a `Confidence_in_Use` score higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents and calculate the average `Confidence_in_Use` for each group

#### Group A:
- Respondent 35: Confidence_in_Use = 1
- Respondent 11: Confidence_in_Use = 3  
**Average = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 44: Confidence_in_Use = 1
- Respondent 3: Confidence_in_Use = 5  
**Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 54: Confidence_in_Use = 4
- Respondent 63: Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent 33: Confidence_in_Use = 4
- Respondent 39: Confidence_in_Use = 4
- Respondent 62: Confidence_in_Use = 5  
**Average = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 10: Confidence_in_Use = 5  
**Average = 5**

---

### Step 2: Count respondents with `Confidence_in_Use` higher than the group average

#### Group A:
- Respondent 35: 1 (≤ 2) → No
- Respondent 11: 3 (> 2) → Yes  
**Count = 1**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 44: 1 (≤ 3) → No
- Respondent 3: 5 (> 3) → Yes  
**Count = 1**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 54: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 63: 5 (> 4.4) → Yes
- Respondent 33: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 39: 4 (≤ 4.4) → No
- Respondent 62: 5 (> 4.4) → Yes  
**Count = 2**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 10: 5 (= 5) → No  
**Count = 0**

---

### Final Count:
**1 (Group A) + 1 (Group B) + 2 (Group C) + 0 (Group D) = 4**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `Group`.
2. Calculate the average `Integration_of_Functions` score for each group.
3. Count the number of respondents in each group whose `Integration_of_Functions` score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by `Group` and calculate the average `Integration_of_Functions` score for each group

#### Group A:
Respondents: 52, 6, 76, 67  
`Integration_of_Functions` scores: 4, 5, 4, 5  
Average: (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = **4.5**

#### Group C:
Respondents: 82, 20  
`Integration_of_Functions` scores: 4, 4  
Average: (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = **4**

#### Group D:
Respondents: 10, 30  
`Integration_of_Functions` scores: 5, 5  
Average: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = **5**

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents whose `Integration_of_Functions` score is higher than the group average

#### Group A:
- Respondent 52: 4 (not higher than 4.5)
- Respondent 6: 5 (higher than 4.5)
- Respondent 76: 4 (not higher than 4.5)
- Respondent 67: 5 (higher than 4.5)  
**Count: 2**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 82: 4 (not higher than 4)
- Respondent 20: 4 (not higher than 4)  
**Count: 0**

#### Group D:
- Respondent 10: 5 (not higher than 5)
- Respondent 30: 5 (not higher than 5)  
**Count: 0**

---

### Final Count:
2 (from Group A) + 0 (from Group C) + 0 (from Group D) = **2**

---

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

   - Respondent 51: Group C (Middle), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1
   - Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
   - Average: 6 / 3 = 2

2. Identify all respondents in the 'Junior' group (Group B) and check which of them have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than 2:
   - Respondent 44: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1 (Not higher than 2)
   - Respondent 66: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1 (Not higher than 2)
   - Respondent 79: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1 (Not higher than 2)

Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Group the respondents by their `Group` value.
2. Calculate the average `Ease_of_Use` score for each group.
3. Count the number of respondents in each group whose `Ease_of_Use` score is higher than the group's average.

### Step 1: Group the respondents and calculate the average `Ease_of_Use` for each group

#### Group A:
- Respondent 72: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 65: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = **5**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 69: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average = 5

#### Group C:
- Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 39: Ease_of_Use = 1
- Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = **3**

#### Group D (Intern):
- Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 41: Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 25: Ease_of_Use = 3
- Average = (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = **4.33**

---

### Step 2: Count respondents whose `Ease_of_Use` is higher than the group average

#### Group A:
- Respondent 72: 5 > 5 → **No**
- Respondent 65: 5 > 5 → **No**
- Count = **0**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 69: 5 > 5 → **No**
- Count = **0**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 17: 5 > 3 → **Yes**
- Respondent 39: 1 > 3 → **No**
- Count = **1**

#### Group D (Intern):
- Respondent 71: 5 > 4.33 → **Yes**
- Respondent 41: 5 > 4.33 → **Yes**
- Respondent 25: 3 > 4.33 → **No**
- Count = **2**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this, I will:

1. Calculate the average `Need_for_Technical_Support` score for each group.
2. Count the number of respondents in each group whose `Need_for_Technical_Support` score is higher than the group's average.

---

### Step 1: Group the respondents by their `Group` and calculate the average `Need_for_Technical_Support` for each group.

#### Group A:
- Respondents: 42, 6
- Scores: 5, 1
- Average: (5 + 1) / 2 = **3**

#### Group B:
- Respondents: 66, 36
- Scores: 1, 1
- Average: (1 + 1) / 2 = **1**

#### Group C:
- Respondents: 9, 53, 88
- Scores: 5, 1, 2
- Average: (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = **2.67**

#### Group D:
- Respondents: 45, 15, 71, 7
- Scores: 1, 1, 1, 1
- Average: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = **1**

---

### Step 2: Count the number of respondents in each group whose `Need_for_Technical_Support` score is higher than the group's average.

#### Group A:
- Respondent 42: 5 > 3 → **Yes**
- Respondent 6: 1 < 3 → **No**
- Count: **1**

#### Group B:
- Respondent 66: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Respondent 36: 1 = 1 → **No**
- Count: **0**

#### Group C:
- Respondent 9: 5 > 2.67 → **Yes**
- Respondent 53: 1 < 2.67 → **No**
- Respondent 88: 2 < 2.67 → **No**
- Count: **1**

#### Group D:
- All scores = 1, and group average = 1 → **No**
- Count: **0**

---

### Final Count:
- Total = 1 (Group A) + 0 (Group B) + 1 (Group C) + 0 (Group D) = **2**

---

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent as the sum of their 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' scores.
2. Group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.
3. For each respondent, compare their total positive usability score to the average of all respondents **not in their group**.
4. Count how many respondents have a total positive usability score **lower than** the average of all respondents not in their group.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total positive usability scores
| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 47         | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| 82         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| 32         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| 61         | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3           |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

---

### Step 2: Group by 'Group' and calculate average total score for each group
- Group A: (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 6.67
- Group B: (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 7.33
- Group C: (8 + 10) / 2 = 9.00
- Group D: (4) / 1 = 4.00

---

### Step 3: Calculate the average for all respondents **not in the same group** for each respondent
- Respondent 64 (Group D): Average of A, B, C = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9.00) / 3 = 7.67
- Respondent 35 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.78
- Respondent 47 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.56
- Respondent 82 (Group C): Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.00
- Respondent 32 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.56
- Respondent 89 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.78
- Respondent 61 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.56
- Respondent 43 (Group C): Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.00
- Respondent 11 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9.00 + 4.00) / 3 = 6.78

---

### Step 4: Count how many respondents have a total score **lower than** the average of all respondents not in their group
- Respondent 64: 4 < 7.67 → ✅
- Respondent 35: 2 < 6.78 → ✅
- Respondent 47: 9 > 6.56 → ❌
- Respondent 82: 8 > 6.00 → ❌
- Respondent 32: 10 > 6.56 → ❌
- Respondent 89: 8 > 6.78 → ❌
- Respondent 61: 3 < 6.56 → ✅
- Respondent 43: 10 > 6.00 → ❌
- Respondent 11: 10 > 6.78 → ❌
