It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.\n\nA 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.",
    "OUTPUT_INSTRUCTIONS": "Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.\n\nRules:\n- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.\n  Example: If the schema is \"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]\" and the response is \"a\", output \"Abnormal\".\n- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.\n- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., \"42\").\n- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., \"17, 21, 23\").\n- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output \"Abnormal\", not \"abnormal\" or \"A\").",
